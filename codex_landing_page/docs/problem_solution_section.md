# Problem & Proof Section

## Purpose
- Establish the operational pain caused by traditional signature capture (scanning, manual cleanup, compliance headaches).
- Position Signature Extractor App as the definitive solution validated by metrics and customer outcomes.

## Structure
1. **Problem Column (left)**
   - Title: "Signature capture is still a manual bottleneck"
   - Bullet pain points:
     - "83% of legal teams still screenshot and crop signatures manually."
     - "Time-to-approval slowed by smudges, skew, and inconsistent resolution."
     - "Compliance teams struggle to prove signature provenance."
2. **Solution Column (right)**
   - Title: "A dedicated desktop workflow fixes the entire chain"
   - Feature highlights with iconography: Auto-orientation, contrast cleanup, instant export.
   - Micro copy referencing local processing and audit-ready outputs.
3. **Metric Banner (full width)**
   - Background chip with stats: "12x faster", "100% local", "ISO-ready audit trails".

## Visual Language
- Two-column layout with diagonal divider to suggest transition from chaos to clarity.
- Left column uses desaturated palette and glitch overlays; right column vibrant and crisp.
- Use icon set with thin-line style to keep design lightweight.

## Interaction Details
- On scroll, columns slide in from opposite sides with easing (`cubic-bezier(.65,.05,.36,1)`).
- Metric banner counts up numbers using lightweight JS IntersectionObserver triggered animation.

## Copywriting Notes
- Keep statistics realistic; cite internal benchmarks in tooltip if desired.
- Avoid jargon like "synergy"; favor "review cycle", "compliance evidence", "handoff".

## Accessibility
- Provide text alternatives for icons.
- Ensure column order reverses gracefully on mobile (Problem first, then Solution) for readability.
