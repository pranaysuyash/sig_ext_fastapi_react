## 1. Product Hunt Launch Best Practices

### Optimal Launch Day & Time

**Best Time:**
- **12:01 AM - 1:00 AM PST** (Product Hunt operates on Pacific Time)
- Product Hunt resets at midnight PST, giving you a full 24-hour window
- Launching at 12:01 AM PST ensures maximum exposure throughout the entire day

**Best Day:**
- **For Maximum Traffic:** Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday
  - Highest engagement and traffic
  - Most competitive days
  - Best for products with strong existing networks

- **For Top Rankings:** Monday or Friday
  - Lower competition
  - Better chance at top spots with fewer upvotes
  - Still maintain good engagement

- **Avoid:** Weekends and holidays (significantly lower engagement)

**Critical Note:** The best day is ultimately when you're most prepared with your community mobilized.

---

### How to Maximize Upvotes

#### The Algorithm & Ranking System

Product Hunt's ranking is determined by:
1. **Upvote Quantity** - Total number of upvotes
2. **Upvote Weight** - Votes from established, active PH members count more
3. **Upvote Velocity** - Rate of upvotes over time (25-50 votes/hour is ideal)
4. **Engagement** - Comments and discussions boost visibility
5. **User Quality** - Long-standing accounts have more weight than new accounts

**Target Benchmarks:**
- **First Hour:** 30-100 upvotes (critical momentum building)
- **First 4 Hours:** Get into top 4 positions (random rotation period ends at 4am PST)
- **Product of the Day:** ~1,000+ upvotes (high confidence level)
- **Top 5:** 300-500 upvotes typically sufficient

#### Maximizing Strategies

**Pre-Launch (3-4 months before):**
- Create Product Hunt account early (algorithm favors established accounts)
- Engage authentically: upvote products, leave thoughtful comments, participate in discussions
- Build relationships with top hunters and community members
- Ask your network to create PH accounts 30 days before launch

**Pre-Launch (3-4 weeks before):**
- Email your list to create PH accounts and start engaging
- Send follow-up email 3 days later asking them to spend 2 minutes upvoting/commenting on other products
- This "warms up" their accounts - votes from active accounts count significantly more

**Launch Day:**
- Mobilize your network across multiple channels simultaneously
- Spread engagement throughout the day to maintain velocity
- First 4 hours are CRITICAL - aim for top 4 position
- Last 2 hours also crucial for final push

**What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Ask directly for upvotes (violates PH Terms of Service)
- ❌ Mass message users
- ❌ Use bots or automation
- ❌ Incentivize upvotes with rewards
- ❌ Create fake accounts
- ❌ Have sudden spikes (looks suspicious)

---

### Hunter vs Maker Launch

**Current Best Practice (2025):** Makers should hunt their own products.

**Why the Change:**
- Product Hunt used to email hunter's followers, making popular hunters valuable
- This mechanism no longer provides the same advantage
- Manual homepage curation is now more important than hunter's follower count
- No discernible advantage to using third-party hunter

**When a Hunter Might Help:**
- You have zero Product Hunt presence
- The hunter has genuine relationships in your target community
- They can provide strategic launch advice
- They'll actively engage throughout launch day

**Bottom Line:** If you've built a solid pre-launch list, you don't need a hunter.

---

### Community Engagement Tactics

#### Active Engagement Strategy

**Launch Day Engagement:**
- Respond to EVERY comment within minutes
- Be present and active throughout the entire day
- Thank early supporters genuinely
- Answer questions thoroughly and helpfully
- Keep conversations going to boost visibility
- Be humble and helpful, not promotional

**First Comment Strategy:**
- YOU should post the first comment (as the maker)
- Make it engaging and discussion-worthy
- Include: brief intro, problem you're solving, why you built it
- End with a thoughtful question to spark discussion
- Mention Product Hunt exclusive offer if applicable

**Comment Response Best Practices:**
- Acknowledge specific points in their comment
- Provide additional context or examples
- Ask follow-up questions
- Show genuine appreciation
- Keep it conversational, not corporate

**Velocity Management:**
- Aim for 25-50 upvotes per hour (steady pace)
- Comments and discussions are as important as upvotes
- Products with comments rank higher than those without
- Active discussion signals genuine interest to the algorithm

#### Multi-Channel Mobilization

**Email:**
- Send to supporters in waves throughout the day (5-6 waves)
- Personalize for different segments
- Never ask for upvotes directly - ask for "support" and "feedback"
- Include clear CTA button with Product Hunt link

**Social Media:**
- Twitter/X: Multiple posts throughout the day
- LinkedIn: Professional audience, emphasize productivity benefits
- Facebook/Slack groups: Relevant communities only (avoid spam)
- Ask team members to share from their accounts

**Direct Outreach:**
- Partners who agreed to support
- Maker friends in the community
- Previous customers/users
- Industry influencers (personalized messages)

**Important:** Ask for "support" and "feedback," never explicitly for "upvotes."

---

### Post-Launch Follow-Up

**Week 1: Capitalize on Momentum**
- Continue responding to comments (monitor for 2 weeks)
- Thank all supporters with personalized messages
- Send follow-up email summarizing results and next steps
- Share updates on social media
- Convert visitors to users with onboarding emails

**Week 2: Product of the Week**
- Your launch page stays active for 2 weeks
- Continue sharing on social media
- Product of the Week and Month are still attainable
- Keep engaging with new comments

**Post-Launch Analysis:**
- Review all comments for product feedback
- Check analytics: traffic sources, signup rates, conversion rates
- Use heatmaps/session recordings to improve landing page
- Reach out to users who left reviews for testimonials
- Ask for reviews on other platforms (G2, Capterra)

**Long-Term Follow-Up:**
- Email new signups with welcome sequence
- Share how feedback has been incorporated
- Announce new features and milestones
- Build lasting relationships, not just one-time interactions

### SignKit First Comment Template

**Template:**

"Hey Product Hunt! 👋 I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to share SignKit with you today.

**The Problem:**
As a [your background], I spent countless hours manually extracting signatures from signed PDFs - copying, cropping, organizing. When you're processing contracts or legal documents, this tedious work adds up fast. I knew there had to be a better way.

**The Solution:**
SignKit is a native Mac app that automatically extracts all signatures from your PDFs in seconds. Just drag and drop your documents, and SignKit finds, extracts, and organizes every signature with perfect accuracy. What used to take hours now happens instantly.

**Why I Built This:**
[Personal story - e.g., "After manually processing 500+ signed contracts for a client project, I hit my breaking point. I spent the next 3 months building the tool I wish I'd had."]

**What Makes It Special:**
- Native Mac app (not a web tool - faster and more private)
- Batch processing - handle hundreds of PDFs at once
- Perfect extraction accuracy with our [tech/algorithm]
- One-time purchase, yours forever - no subscription

**Product Hunt Exclusive: $29 Lifetime Deal** 🎉
For the PH community, we're offering SignKit for just $29 (lifetime access, no subscription). This is our launch special and won't last forever.

**I'd love your feedback:** What types of documents do you work with where this would save you time? Are there specific features you'd want to see?

Thanks for checking us out! I'll be here all day answering questions. 🙏"

---

**Customization Notes:**
- Fill in personal background
- Add your specific "aha moment" story
- Adjust technical details based on your implementation
- Make the question relevant to your target users

- Ask follow-up question
- Show interest in their use case

---

#### 2. Questions About Features
**Example:** "Does this work with scanned PDFs?"

**Keys:**
- Answer directly and completely
- Provide additional helpful context
- Show commitment to improvement
- Offer personal help if needed

---

#### 3. Feature Requests
**Example:** "Any plans to add batch export to PNG?"

"Love this idea! Batch export is something we've heard from a few users now. We currently export as [formats], but PNG batch export makes total sense. I'm adding it to our roadmap - would this be a daily use feature for you?"

**Keys:**
- Acknowledge the request positively
- Explain current state
- Indicate you're considering it
- Ask for more context

---

#### 4. Comparisons to Competitors
**Example:** "How is this different from [Competitor]?"

We're laser-focused on making signature extraction as fast and accurate as possible. Happy to answer specific comparison questions!"

**Keys:**
- Be respectful of competitors
- Acknowledge what they do well
- Clearly state your differentiators
- Stay factual, not promotional
- Offer to provide more details

---

#### 5. Technical/Integration Questions
**Example:** "Does this have an API for integration?"

**Response Template:**
"Not currently - we built v1.0 as a focused desktop app to nail the core experience. But API access is on our roadmap if there's demand! What would you integrate it with? Always interested to understand use cases we haven't considered."

**Keys:**
- Be honest about current limitations
- Show openness to evolution
- Ask about their specific need
- Position as learning opportunity

---

#### 6. Pricing Questions
**Example:** "Why lifetime vs subscription?"

**Response Template:**

**Keys:**
- Explain philosophy
- Connect to user benefit
- Reinforce special offer
- Show appreciation

---

#### 7. Constructive Criticism
**Example:** "The UI looks a bit dated."

**Response Template:**

**Keys:**
- Thank them for feedback

- Explain context
- Ask for specifics
- Show you're taking action

---

#### 8. Skepticism or Concerns
**Example:** "How can you afford $29 lifetime? Seems unsustainable."

- Paid promotion (if any)
- Discount/offer (opportunity cost)
- Tools and software used

**Revenue:**
- Direct sales from launch

- Future sales from awareness

**Example for SignKit:**

**Costs:**
- 160 team hours × $50/hr = $8,000

- Design assets = $300
- Total investment = **$8,800**

**Revenue (moderate scenario):**
- Direct sales: $11,600
- 500 email signups × $5 estimated value = $2,500
- Total measurable return = **$14,100**

**ROI:** ($14,100 - $8,800) / $8,800 = **60% ROI**

**Note:** This doesn't include long-tail sales, brand value, or PR benefits.
