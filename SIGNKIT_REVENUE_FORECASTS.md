## CONCLUSION

### The Reality Check

These forecasts are **realistic but not guaranteed**. The most likely outcome falls between Conservative and Moderate scenarios ($20K-$70K Year 1 revenue).

**Key Dependencies:**
1. Product Hunt performance (biggest variable in M1-2)
2. SEO traction timeline (biggest variable M3-12)
3. Conversion rate optimization (controllable)
4. Market size and competition (external)
5. Execution quality (controllable)

**Success Probability:**
- Conservative outcome: 60-70% probability
- Moderate outcome: 30-40% probability
- Optimistic outcome: 10-15% probability

**Most Important Metrics:**
1. LTV:CAC ratio (must be >1.5:1)
2. Month-over-month growth (need 10%+ sustained)
3. Refund rate (must be <12%)
4. One profitable channel (at least one with <$20 CAC)

**Bottom Line:**
SignKit can be a viable business at $29 price point, but requires:
- Strong organic/content strategy (50-70% of sales)
- Exceptional Product Hunt launch
- Disciplined paid advertising (retargeting focus)
- Continuous conversion optimization
- 6-12 month runway to profitability

With realistic expectations and disciplined execution, SignKit should reach $30K-60K revenue in Year 1 and be positioned for $100K-200K in Year 2.
