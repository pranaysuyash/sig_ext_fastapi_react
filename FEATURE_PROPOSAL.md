# Feature Proposal: Signature Style Transfer

This document proposes a new feature, **Signature Style Transfer**, which would allow users to apply various artistic styles to their extracted signatures. This would be a unique and engaging feature that leverages the application's core functionality while adding a creative twist.

## 1. Concept

The Signature Style Transfer feature would enable users to transform their extracted signatures into different artistic styles, such as:

*   **Calligraphy:** Emulate the look of a fountain pen or a brush pen.
*   **Vintage:** Give the signature an aged, historical appearance.
*   **Neon:** Make the signature glow with a neon effect.
*   **Watercolor:** Apply a soft, blended watercolor texture.
*   **Custom:** Allow users to upload their own style images.

This feature would appeal to a wide range of users, from those who want to add a personal touch to their email signatures to artists and designers who want to incorporate stylized signatures into their work.

## 2. Technical Implementation

The Signature Style Transfer feature could be implemented using a combination of traditional image processing techniques and deep learning models:

*   **Image Processing:** For simpler styles like calligraphy and neon, we can use OpenCV to manipulate the signature's thickness, color, and texture.
*   **Deep Learning:** For more complex styles like watercolor and custom styles, we can use a neural style transfer model (e.g., a pre-trained model like the one from `torch.hub` or a custom-trained model) to transfer the style from a style image to the signature.

## 3. UI/UX

The UI for this feature could be a new tab or a modal window in the desktop application. It would include:

*   A gallery of pre-defined styles for the user to choose from.
*   A file upload button for users to upload their own style images.
*   A real-time preview of the stylized signature.
*   Sliders and other controls to adjust the intensity of the style transfer.

## 4. Backend and API

The backend would need a new endpoint to handle the style transfer requests. This endpoint would take the signature image and the style image (or the name of a pre-defined style) as input and return the stylized signature.

## 5. Monetization

This feature could be a premium feature, available to users on the "Pro" or "Team" plans. This would provide an additional incentive for users to upgrade from the free plan.
