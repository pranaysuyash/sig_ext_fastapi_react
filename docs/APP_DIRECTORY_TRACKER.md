**📝 FIRST COMMENT TEMPLATE (Post this NOW):**

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

Thanks for checking out SignKit! I'm Pranay, and I'm thrilled to share this with you.

**A bit more context:**

I built SignKit because I was tired of uploading sensitive documents to cloud services just to extract a signature. Adobe costs $240/year, DocuSign $120/year—that's $360+ annually for basic signature features.

**What makes SignKit different:**
• 100% local processing - your documents never leave your machine
• Professional-grade extraction with zoom and threshold controls
• Built-in PDF signing (extract once, use everywhere)
• Cross-platform: macOS (ARM64 & Intel), Windows, Linux
• One-time $29 payment - own it forever

**Black Friday Special:**
Launching today at $29 (regularly $39). No subscription. No tracking. No cloud.

**Try it risk-free:**
Full trial available at https://signkit.work - test all features before buying.

**I'd love your feedback on:**
1. Is the value proposition clear?
2. Pricing - fair for a one-time payment?
3. What features would you want added?
4. Any privacy concerns I should address?

I'll be here all day answering questions and taking feedback. Thanks for the support! 🙏

— Pranay

**💡 RESPONSE TEMPLATES:**

**For positive feedback:**

```
Thank you so much! 🙏 Really appreciate the support. Let me know if you have any questions or feature requests!
```

**For questions about pricing:**

```
Great question! It's $29 one-time (no subscription) because I wanted to avoid the $360/year Adobe+DocuSign trap. You own it forever, including all future updates. Free trial available so you can test everything first!
```

**For privacy concerns:**

```
Privacy is our #1 priority! Everything processes locally on your machine - no cloud uploads, no tracking, no data collection. Your documents never leave your computer. You can even use it offline.
```

**For feature requests:**

```
Love this idea! 📝 I'm keeping a list of feature requests from the community. Would you mind if I reach out when we implement this?
```

**For Windows/Linux questions:**

```
Yes! We have builds for Windows and Linux too (plus both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs). Download options at https://signkit.work
```

**Expected Results:**

- Top 10: 5,000-10,000 visits
- Top 5: 10,000-20,000 visits
