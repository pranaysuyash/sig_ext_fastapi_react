# Launch Top 10 - Status Report

This document maps your "Launch Top 10" list to what's been implemented, what needs to be done, and what should be skipped for the first release.

**Summary: 4 done / 2 in-progress / 4 pending (must-do) / 0 skip**

---

## 1. Evaluation Gate [~] IN PROGRESS

**Your requirement:** Export/save disabled until license present; clear CTA in export dialog/status bar; unlock immediately after key entry; license cached offline.

**Current state:**

- [x] License menu with Buy link (uses GUMROAD_PRODUCT_URL env)
- [x] Local license entry/storage (desktop_app/license/)
- [~] Soft non-blocking mode (no hard gate; optional only)
- [ ] Export/Save disabled until license (NOT IMPLEMENTED - currently always enabled)
- [ ] Clear CTA banner/reminder

**Decision:** **MODIFY APPROACH**

- We implemented a _soft_ evaluation mode (non-blocking, optional license only)
- Your spec calls for a _hard_ gate (export disabled until license)
- **Recommendation:** Stick with soft gate for early adopters OR implement hard gate now
- **Action needed:** Decide on hard vs soft gate; implement banner/CTA if soft; implement disable logic if hard

**Code files:** `desktop_app/views/main_window.py`, `desktop_app/license/storage.py`

## Recommended Action Plan

---

## Notes

- **Database:** Currently optional; JWT_SECRET is required for backend auth (not strictly needed if you remove auth routes)
- **Port 8001:** Desktop client expects this; backend usually runs on 8001
- **Unsigned builds:** Acceptable for early adopters with clear Gatekeeper bypass instructions
- **Hard gate vs soft gate:** Your spec says hard (disable export); we built soft (optional license). Decide which to ship.
