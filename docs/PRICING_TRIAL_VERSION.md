## Pricing Philosophy

2. **Lifetime option**: One-time payment for anti-subscription buyers
3. **Subscription for power users**: Cloud sync, API, advanced features
4. **No free forever**: Creates urgency and qualifies serious users

## Pricing Tiers

### 🎯 Free Trial (7 Days)

**$0 - Full feature trial**

**Trial Enforcement:**

- Device fingerprinting (hardware ID) to prevent reinstall abuse

- Trial status stored locally + backend check (if online)
- Clear messaging: "3 days, 5 extractions remaining"

**Perfect for**: Evaluating if the tool fits your workflow
**Rationale**: 7 days + 10 extractions is enough to understand value without giving it away

- Enterprise deals need dedicated sales team and support

**When to add:**

- When customers are asking for team features

**Estimated pricing (future reference):**

- Team: ~$30/user/month (min 3 users)
- Enterprise: Custom ($500+/month)

## Why No Free Forever Plan?

**You're right to question offering "free forever"** - Here's why this approach is better:

### Problems with Free Forever

1. **No revenue** from 80-90% of users who never upgrade
2. **Support burden** - Free users expect help but don't pay
3. **Devalues the product** - "If it's free, it must not be worth much"
4. **Attracts wrong users** - People looking for "free stuff" not serious buyers
5. **Hard to convert** - Users resist paying after getting it free

### Benefits of 14-Day Trial

1. **Creates urgency** - Users must evaluate and decide
2. **Qualifies buyers** - Only serious users download
3. **Higher conversion** - Trials convert 20-40% vs free's 2-5%
4. **Clear value** - Time-limit signals this is worth paying for
5. **Better support** - Focus resources on paying customers

### Why Lifetime Makes Sense

1. **Captures "anti-subscription" buyers** - Huge market segment
2. **Upfront cash** - Better than waiting for monthly revenue
3. **Sticky customers** - They paid, they'll use it and recommend it
4. **Competitive edge** - Most competitors are subscription-only
5. **Fair pricing** - $49 = 4 months of Pro, but lifetime value

### Why NOT Free Forever?

**Your insight is correct:** Most B2C users only need 5-10 extractions total!

**The Problem:**

- If 10 extractions is "enough" for most users...
- Then a 10-extraction trial = free forever (just reinstall)
- You get zero revenue from 95% of users

**Alternative Strategy (No Free Tier):**

**Option 1: Demo Mode Only**

- No trial, just video demo on website
- "See it work, then buy" model
- Money-back guarantee (30 days)
- **Risk:** Lower conversion, but higher commitment

**Option 2: Freemium with Hard Limits**

- 3 extractions forever (enough to test, not enough to use)
- Must buy Lifetime to get more
- **Risk:** Users may share licenses

**Option 3: One-Time Purchase Only**

- $49 Lifetime (no trial at all)
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- "Try it risk-free" messaging
- **Risk:** Friction at purchase point

**Recommended: Stick with 7-day/10-extraction trial BUT:**

- ✅ Device fingerprinting (prevent reinstalls)
- ✅ No session saving in trial (prevent workarounds)
- ✅ Backend activation check (require email)
- ✅ Clear upgrade prompts

This creates legitimate evaluation period while preventing abuse.

## Pricing Psychology

### Why $29 for Lifetime?

- **Impulse-buy threshold**: Under $30 = minimal purchase friction
- **Cheaper than competitors' 2-3 months**: Adobe ($20/mo), DocuSign ($10-40/mo)
- **"Why not?" pricing**: So cheap people buy without overthinking
- **Gift-friendly**: Easy to expense, recommend to colleagues
- **Psychological anchor**: "Lifetime access for less than a tank of gas"

### The $29 Sweet Spot

**Too low ($9-19):**
- Looks "cheap" or suspicious
- Hard to add Pro tier later (only $12/mo)
- Revenue too low per user

**Too high ($49-69):**
- Back in "I need to think about it" territory
- Requires trial to justify (complexity)
- Competes with Affinity Photo ($69)

**Just right ($29):**
- ✅ Feels like a steal for lifetime access
- ✅ Impulse purchase (no hesitation)
- ✅ Room to add $12/mo Pro later
- ✅ High perceived value vs cost

### Comparison Messaging

**Your Website:**
> "Lifetime access for $29. That's less than 3 months of Smallpdf, or 2 months of Adobe Acrobat. Pay once, use forever."

**Social Proof:**
> "Adobe charges $240/year for basic PDF tools. We give you precision signature extraction for $29, lifetime. No brainer."

## Summary

**Recommended Strategy (Solo Dev Focus)**:

✅ **Remove "Free Forever" tier** - No ads, no freemium trap  
✅ **7-day trial with 10 extractions** - Enough to evaluate, not enough to abuse  
✅ **Lifetime Desktop at $49** - Main revenue driver for solo dev  
✅ **Pro at $12/mo** (Phase 2) - Add cloud features later when backend scales  
❌ **Skip Team/Enterprise** - Too complex for solo dev, add only after PMF + team

**Solo Dev Priorities:**

1. **Launch with Lifetime only** (simplest, immediate cash)
2. **Add Pro in 3-6 months** (once you have 100+ Lifetime customers)
3. **Consider Team in Year 2** (once you have help or funding)

This creates urgency, qualifies serious users, and keeps complexity LOW for solo development.
