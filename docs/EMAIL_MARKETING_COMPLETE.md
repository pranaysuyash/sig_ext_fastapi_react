#### Email 3: Social Proof (Day 7)
**Subject:** How [Customer] saved $400/year with SignKit

```
Hi [Name],

Quick story:

Sarah, a freelance designer, was paying DocuSign $25/month.

She signed 3-4 contracts per month.

Over 2 years: $600.

She switched to SignKit: $29 once.

Her savings: $571 over 2 years.

Her words:
"I'll never pay for e-signature software again. 
This paid for itself in the first month."

Sound familiar?

If you're signing documents regularly, SignKit pays for 
itself in 1-2 months vs DocuSign.

Try it risk-free for 30 days:

#### Email 4: Objection Handling (Day 14)
**Subject:** "Is SignKit really as good as DocuSign?"

```
Hi [Name],

Halfway through your trial! 🎉

I get this question a lot:

"Is SignKit really as good as DocuSign?"

Short answer: For 90% of users, yes.

Long answer:

DocuSign is better if you need:
• Enterprise features (SSO, admin controls)
• Complex workflows (multi-party signing)
• Integrations with Salesforce, etc.

SignKit is better if you need:
• Simple signature extraction and signing
• Complete privacy (local processing)
• One-time pricing (not $300/year)
• Fast performance (<1 second)

Most freelancers, consultants, and small businesses 
don't need DocuSign's complexity.

They need SignKit's simplicity.

Which are you?
