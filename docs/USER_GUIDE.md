### Tips & Tricks

**Better Extraction:**
- Use high-resolution scans (300 DPI or higher)
- Ensure good contrast between signature and background
- Clean the document before scanning if possible
- Adjust threshold if signature is too thin/thick

**Threshold Guide:**
- Lower (100-150): Captures faint signatures
- Medium (150-200): Standard signatures
- Higher (200-255): Bold, dark signatures only
- Use "Auto" for quick optimization

**Performance:**
- Large images (>10 MB) may take a few seconds
- No internet required - works completely offline
- Processing happens locally on your Mac
