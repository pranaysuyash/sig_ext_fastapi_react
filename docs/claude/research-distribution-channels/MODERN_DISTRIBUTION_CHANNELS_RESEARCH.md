**2025 Launch Strategy:**

**Critical Changes in 2025:**
- Product Hunt team **manually decides** which products make homepage
- Filtering has become "ruthlessly selective" in 2025
- Featured products start with certain number of upvotes
- Harder to catch up if not featured initially

**Pre-Launch (Essential Foundation):**
- **Biggest Mistake:** Treating Product Hunt as your first marketing channel
- **Target:** Find **500 people** who can help you succeed (good average for top 5 of the day)
- **One Week Before:** Create Product Hunt teaser page as warm-up
- **Required:** Already have community excited about your product

**Optimal Launch Timing:**

**Time:**
- Launch at **12:01 AM PDT** (Product Hunt's timezone)
- Maximize 24-hour visibility window

**Day of Week:**
- **Tuesday or Wednesday** safest
- **Avoid Monday** (news cycles)
- **Weekend:** Less competition but lower traffic
- **Weekday:** More traffic but higher competition

**Launch Day Execution:**

**Critical Hours:**

**Hour-by-Hour Strategy:**
- Split day into several time windows

- Working with influencers provides major advantage in final hours
- Budget example: $565 spent in one successful case study
- Target tech/product influencers on Twitter, LinkedIn

- Each launch = new opportunity to find customers
- Build on previous launch learnings

**Key Metrics for Success:**

- Featured vs. non-featured makes significant difference

- Tech products and SaaS
