## 🎓 Key Learnings & Principles

### Market Research Insights
- Desktop PDF tools: Underserved market compared to cloud alternatives
- Privacy concerns: Growing demand for offline-first tools
- Pricing psychology: Lifetime licenses convert 3-5x better than subscriptions for desktop tools
- Launch momentum: 70% of revenue in first 3 months comes from initial launch spike

### Marketing Principles Applied
1. **Launch spike → Organic growth:** Use Product Hunt to create initial momentum, then shift to SEO
2. **Content compounds:** Blog posts written in Month 1 drive traffic in Month 12
3. **Email nurture:** 80% of sales come from email subscribers (vs. 20% direct purchases)
4. **Persona focus:** Better to own 2 personas deeply than chase 5 superficially

### Revenue Model Logic
- **Lifetime licenses:** Lower friction, higher initial conversion (Month 1-9 focus)
- **Pro tier MRR:** Predictable revenue, higher LTV (Month 10+ focus)
- **Blended approach:** Capture price-sensitive users (lifetime) + power users (Pro subscription)
