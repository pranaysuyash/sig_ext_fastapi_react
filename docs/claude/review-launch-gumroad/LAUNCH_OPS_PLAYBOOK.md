Would you be interested in being a beta tester when I work on this feature?

Hi [Name],

I'm sorry to hear SignKit didn't meet your needs.

I've processed your refund request through Gumroad. You should see the refund in your account within 5-7 business days.

Your license has been deactivated, but you can continue using the free trial version if you'd like.

Before you go, I'd love to understand what didn't work for you. Your feedback helps me improve the product. Would you mind sharing:
• What feature were you looking for that was missing?
• Was there a technical issue?
• Anything else I should know?

No pressure to respond, but I genuinely appreciate any insights.

Thank you for giving SignKit a try!
