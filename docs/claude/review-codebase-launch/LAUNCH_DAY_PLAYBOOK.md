## 🚨 Crisis Management

### If Sales Are Slow

**Don't panic!** Day 1 is rarely representative.

**Instead**:
- Focus on engagement, not sales
- Collect feedback from free trial users
- Improve messaging based on questions you get
- Double down on content that resonates
- Consider a small discount (10-20%) to unstick buyers

### If There's a Critical Bug

**Steps**:
1. Acknowledge publicly: "We're aware and fixing it"
2. Provide workaround if possible
3. Fix ASAP (drop everything else)
4. Deploy patch
5. Email affected users directly
6. Post update: "Fixed in version 1.0.1"

**Don't**:
- Ignore it
- Get defensive
- Blame users
- Take too long to respond

### If You Get Negative Feedback

**Remember**:
- It's about the product, not you
- Negative feedback is a gift
- Early adopters are forgiving if you're responsive

**Response template**:
> Thanks for the feedback! You're absolutely right about [issue]. We're working on a fix and will have it ready by [timeframe]. In the meantime, here's a workaround: [solution]. DM me if you'd like a refund - no hard feelings!

### If Website/Gumroad Goes Down

**Backup plan**:
- Have direct download links ready
- Use Google Drive/Dropbox as backup
- Post alternative purchase method
- Apologize and offer discount for inconvenience
