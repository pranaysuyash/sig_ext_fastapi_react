## 🔴 REMAINING TASKS

### Critical (Must Do Before Launch)

#### 1. Rebuild Other Platforms (2-3 hours)
You have 3 options:

**Option A: Use GitHub Actions CI/CD**
```bash
# Trigger the build workflow
# This will build all platforms automatically
git push  # Already done!
# Check: https://github.com/pranaysuyash/signkit/actions
```

**Option B: Build Locally (macOS only)**
```bash
# You can only build macOS Intel on your ARM Mac
./build-tools/build_all_platforms.sh macos
```

**Option C: Launch with ARM64 Only**
- Launch with just the ARM64 build today
- Add Intel/Windows/Linux builds within 24-48 hours
- Most Mac users have Apple Silicon now anyway

**Recommendation:** Option C - Launch with ARM64, add others soon

#### 2. Screenshots & Demo Video (4-6 hours)
**Must create:**
- 10-12 screenshots showing workflow
- 60-90 second demo video

**How to create:**
```bash
# Option 1: Use automated script
python scripts/final_screenshot_capture.py

# Option 2: Manual capture
# 1. Open SignKit
# 2. Use Cmd+Shift+4 to capture
# 3. Show: Load → Select → Extract → Library → PDF signing
```

#### 3. Upload to Gumroad (30 minutes)
- [ ] Upload ARM64 DMG (ready now)
- [ ] Upload other builds (when ready)
- [ ] Add screenshots
- [ ] Add demo video
- [ ] Test download links
