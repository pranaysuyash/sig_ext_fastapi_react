Title: Show HN: SignKit – Extract signatures with complete privacy (Black Friday: $19)

Hey HN!

I built SignKit - a desktop app for extracting signatures from documents
with complete privacy. All processing happens locally on your computer.

Why I built it:
I needed to extract signatures for contracts but didn't trust cloud
services with sensitive documents. Existing tools either compromised
privacy or cost $240/year (Adobe).

What it does:
• Extract signatures from any document (PDF, JPG, PNG)
• Precision selection with zoom/pan controls
• Export as clean, transparent PNG
• Place signatures directly on PDFs
• 100% local processing (no cloud uploads)

Tech stack:
• Python + Qt for desktop UI
• OpenCV for image processing
• PyMuPDF for PDF handling
• PyInstaller for distribution

Black Friday special: $19 (35% off regular $29)

Free trial available - test all features before buying.

Demo: [YouTube link]
Landing page: [link]
GitHub: [if open source]

Would love your feedback on the approach and implementation!

🚀 Excited to launch SignKit for Black Friday!

After 6 months of development, I'm launching a privacy-first tool for
extracting signatures from documents.

sensitive documents daily. Cloud-based tools expose this data to
potential breaches.

SignKit processes everything locally on your computer. Your documents
never leave your device.

✨ Perfect for:
• Contract management
• Document signing workflows
• Medical form processing
• Real estate transactions

# Black Friday Launch Strategy for Signature Extractor

## Timeline: November 13 → November 28/29 (15-16 days)

### Why Black Friday?

**Advantages:**

- 🔥 **Peak buying season** - people expect deals and are shopping-ready
- 💰 **Higher conversion rates** - discount psychology works
- 📢 **Media attention** - tech press covers Black Friday deals
- 🚀 **Urgency** - "limited time" creates FOMO
- 🎯 **Budget approval** - businesses spending year-end budgets

**Risks:**

- ⚠️ **Crowded marketplace** - competing with thousands of deals
- ⏰ **Time pressure** - only 15 days to prepare
- 📉 **Discount expectation** - customers may wait for deeper cuts
- 🔍 **Less attention** - your product can get buried

**Our Situation:**

- New product (v1.0) - no existing customer base
- Niche tool (signature extraction) - not mass market
- $29 price point - already affordable
- No brand recognition yet

---

## Launch Strategy Options

### Option A: Black Friday Launch Deal (RECOMMENDED)

**Launch Date:** November 25-26 (Monday/Tuesday before BF)  
**Deal Runs:** Nov 25 - Dec 2 (Cyber Monday inclusive)

**Pricing Structure:**

```
Regular Price: $29
Black Friday Deal: $19 (34% off)
OR
Black Friday Deal: $20 (31% off - easier number)

Headline: "Launch Special: $19 (Save $10)"
```

**Why this works:**

- ✅ Creates launch + discount double urgency
- ✅ Builds initial customer base at lower price
- ✅ Gets testimonials/reviews before full price
- ✅ Justifies discount (launch special, not desperate)
- ✅ Can raise to full $29 after, feeling premium

**Timeline:**

- **Nov 13-20:** Final polish, beta testing, fix critical bugs
- **Nov 21-24:** Marketing prep, screenshots, landing page
- **Nov 25:** Launch at $19 with countdown timer
- **Nov 29-Dec 2:** Last chance messaging
- **Dec 3+:** Regular $29 price

### Option B: Pre-Launch Beta → Black Friday Release

**Beta Period:** Nov 15-24  
**Launch:** Nov 25 with Black Friday pricing

**Pricing:**

```
Beta Access: Free (email required)
Black Friday Launch: $19 (early adopter price)
Post-BF Regular: $29
```

**Why this works:**

- ✅ Builds email list during beta
- ✅ Gets feedback before launch
- ✅ Creates buzz and anticipation
- ✅ Beta users become evangelists
- ✅ Discount feels earned (early adopter reward)

### Option C: Standard Launch, Skip Black Friday

**Launch:** Early December after BF madness  
**Price:** Full $29 from day one

**Why consider:**

- ✅ Less competition for attention
- ✅ No "cheap" positioning from start
- ✅ More time to polish
- ✅ Holiday budget still available
- ❌ Miss peak shopping momentum
- ❌ Lower urgency

## Black Friday Marketing Channels

### 1. Product Hunt (CRITICAL)

**Launch Day:** Tuesday Nov 26 (highest traffic day)

**Resource:** Product Hunt Launch Checklist

### 2. Reddit (HIGH VALUE)

**Target Subreddits:**

- r/macapps (100k+ members) - "Show & Tell" posts allowed
- r/productivity (1.8M) - careful with self-promotion rules
- r/MacOS (800k) - tools/apps discussion
- r/digitalnomad (1.4M) - many need e-signatures
- r/realestate (500k) - heavy signature usage
- r/smallbusiness (800k) - document signing pain

**Strategy:**

```markdown
Title: "I built a Mac app to extract clean signatures from documents - $19 launch special"

Body:
Hey r/macapps! After years of frustration with messy signature
extraction, I built Signature Extractor - a native Mac app that
cleanly isolates signatures from scanned documents with transparent
backgrounds.

[Demo GIF showing before/after]

Features:

- Offline processing (no cloud, privacy-first)
- One-click extraction with smart threshold
- Works with messy scans & photos
- Export to PNG with transparency
- Native Mac app (M1/M2/Intel)

Launching for Black Friday at $19 (regular $29). Would love
feedback from this community!

[Link to Gumroad/Website]
```

**Timing:**

- Monday Nov 25: r/macapps (8am EST)
- Tuesday Nov 26: r/productivity (10am EST)

- Try Monday Nov 25 or Tuesday Dec 3

**Strategy:**

- Technical angle: "Built with PySide6, OpenCV, offline-first"
- Problem-first: "Solving the 'scan your signature' pain"
- Be present in comments for 2-3 hours
- Don't be too salesy (HN hates that)

**Expected Impact:** Front page = 10,000-50,000 visits

**Risk:** HN can be harsh on commercial products

### 4. Twitter/X Tech Community

**Strategy:**

```tweet

   - CTA: "Get it for $19 (Regular $29)"
   - Countdown timer: "Deal ends Dec 2"

      - Deploy notes: The canonical landing site is `web/live` on the `landing-page` branch. To publish the latest landing changes to Cloudflare Pages you can:
         - Run locally: `export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=... && export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=... && ./tools/deploy_to_pages.sh`
         - Use the GitHub Action: `.github/workflows/manual_publish_landing.yml` (workflow_dispatch) — requires the repo secrets `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. You can optionally pass a `branch` input to the workflow to publish `web/live` from a specific branch (default: `landing-page`).
         - There's also an automatic guarded publish workflow (`.github/workflows/auto_publish_landing.yml`) which will only publish `web/live` if the push contains changes restricted to `web/live` or the root landing pages (`index.html`, `buy.html`, `purchase.html`, `gum.html`, `root.html`). This guards against accidental wide-scope commits being published.

## Pricing Strategy Deep Dive

### Black Friday Discount Options

**Option 1: Simple Dollar Off**

```
Regular: $29
Black Friday: $19
Savings: $10 (34% off)

Messaging: "Save $10 - Launch Special"
```

✅ Clear, simple math  
✅ $19 feels like impulse buy  
✅ Round number psychology

**Option 2: Percentage Based**

```
Regular: $29
Black Friday: $20 (31% off)

Messaging: "31% OFF Launch Deal"
```

✅ Percentage sounds bigger  
❌ $20 less memorable than $19

**Option 3: Bundle Deal**

```
Regular: $29
Black Friday: $19 + Free v2 Upgrade

Messaging: "Launch Bundle - App + Future Upgrades"
```

✅ Higher perceived value  
✅ Locks in future revenue  
❌ Complex to explain  
❌ May cannibalize v2 sales

**RECOMMENDATION: Option 1 ($19)**

### Post-Black Friday Pricing

**Step-Up Strategy:**

```
Nov 25 - Dec 2:  $19 (Black Friday)
Dec 3 - Dec 15:  $24 (Holiday Special)
Dec 16+:         $29 (Regular Price)
```

**Rationale:**

- Gradual increase feels fair
- Creates FOMO at each stage
- Tests price sensitivity
- $24 still feels like discount

**Alternative: Hold $29 From Day One Post-BF**

```
Nov 25 - Dec 2:  $19 (Black Friday ONLY)
Dec 3+:          $29 (Regular Price)

Messaging: "Black Friday pricing ended - now $29"
```

**Rationale:**

- Clear value of discount
- Establishes premium positioning
- No confusion about "real" price

## Risk Mitigation

### What Could Go Wrong?

- **Mitigation:** Don't put all eggs in one basket
- **Backup:** Reddit, HN, direct outreach still work
- **Learning:** Study successful PH launches beforehand

- **Backup:** Extend deal through Cyber Monday
- **Learning:** Clear unique value prop needed

**Risk 3: Price Too Low ($19)**

- **Mitigation:** Clear messaging that $29 is regular
- **Backup:** Raise to $24 on Dec 3, then $29 Dec 16
- **Learning:** A/B test pricing post-launch

**Risk 4: Technical Issues on Launch Day**

- **Mitigation:** Beta test heavily week before
- **Backup:** Have rollback plan ready
- **Learning:** Test purchase flow 10+ times

**Risk 5: No Press Pickup**

- **Mitigation:** Don't rely on press
- **Backup:** Community-driven launch works
