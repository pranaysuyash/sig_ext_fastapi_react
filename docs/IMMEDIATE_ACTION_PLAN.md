```

### Action 3: Hacker News Show HN (30 minutes)
**Why:** Technical audience, high-quality traffic

**Read:** `docs/INDIE_MICROSAAS_COMPLETE.md` (Hacker News section)

**Steps:**
1. Post same day as Product Hunt (8 AM EST)
2. Title: "Show HN: SignKit – Extract signatures from documents"
3. Focus on technical implementation in first comment
4. Respond to EVERY comment within 1 hour

**First Comment Template:**
```
Hey HN! I built SignKit to solve a problem I had as a freelancer - 
signing contracts without printing/scanning.

Technical highlights:
- Local-first processing (no cloud upload required)
- OpenCV + K-means for signature extraction
- PyQt6 desktop app (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- SQLite for local storage
- Optional FastAPI backend

The interesting challenge was separating ink from background on 
poor-quality scans. I used K-means clustering in "forensic mode" 
to isolate signature strokes.

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!
```

**Expected Result:** 200-1000 views, 10-50 downloads, 1-5 sales

---

### Action 4: Reddit Posts (1 hour)
**Why:** Niche communities, engaged users

**Read:** `docs/INDIE_MICROSAAS_COMPLETE.md` (Reddit section)

**Post to these 5 subreddits:**
1. r/SideProject - "Launched SignKit: Extract signatures from PDFs"
2. r/productivity - "Tool I built to sign documents 10x faster"
3. r/entrepreneur - "Solving the signature problem for freelancers"
4. r/freelance - "Stop printing and scanning contracts"
5. r/smallbusiness - "Sign documents without DocuSign ($29 vs $180/year)"

**Post Template:**
```
Title: [Launched] SignKit - Extract signatures from documents

I'm a freelancer who got tired of printing/scanning contracts just to sign them.

Built SignKit to solve this:
- Extract your signature from any document
- Reuse it on PDFs forever
- Works 100% offline
- One-time $29 (no subscription)

The unique part: It's the only tool that EXTRACTS signatures. 
DocuSign/Adobe make you draw or upload, but can't extract from existing docs.

Try it free: signkit.work

Would love feedback from fellow [freelancers/entrepreneurs/etc]!
