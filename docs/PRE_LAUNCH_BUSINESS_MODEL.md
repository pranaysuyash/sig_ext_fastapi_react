## Conclusion

The pre-launch analysis suggests a **cautious, phased approach**:

1. **Start with basic lifetime model** to validate core market demand
2. **Build customer base** and gather feedback before adding complexity
3. **Introduce Pro tier** based on proven feature demand
4. **Evaluate subscription model** after understanding customer lifetime value
5. **Maintain privacy-first positioning** as core differentiator

This approach allows for market validation before committing to long-term business model decisions. The lack of existing users provides the flexibility to adjust the model based on actual market response rather than managing existing customer expectations.

The key insight is that the lifetime model can serve as a market validation tool, with subscription features added once the core value proposition is proven and sustainable development funding is needed.
