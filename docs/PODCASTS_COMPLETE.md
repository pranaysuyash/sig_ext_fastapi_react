## 🎯 TALKING POINTS FOR SIGNKIT

### Your Core Story (2-3 minutes):
"I was frustrated with uploading sensitive contracts to DocuSign just to 
extract a signature. $25/month felt excessive for such a simple task. Plus, 
I didn't like uploading confidential documents to the cloud.

So I built SignKit - a desktop app that uses computer vision to extract 
signatures in under 1 second, completely offline. Everything processes locally 
on your device.

The response has been incredible. We've done $X in revenue in Y months with 
a one-time $29 purchase. No subscriptions, no cloud uploads, no per-document 
fees.

It's been a masterclass in competing with billion-dollar companies by focusing 
on what they can't or won't do: privacy-first, one-time pricing, and actually 
respecting users."

### Key Messages:
1. **Privacy First:** "Documents never leave your device"
2. **One-Time Pricing:** "$29 once vs $300/year"
3. **Speed:** "Under 1 second vs 30+ seconds"
4. **Bootstrapped:** "Profitable from day 1, no VC"
5. **Technical:** "Computer vision with OpenCV"

### Interesting Angles:
- Desktop apps aren't dead
- Privacy as competitive moat
- Competing with giants as solo founder
- One-time pricing in subscription world
- Building from India for global market
- Technical challenges of CV
- Marketing without big budget
