## Objection Handling Copy

### "I can do this in Photoshop"

```html
<p><strong>"I can do this in Photoshop"</strong></p>
<p>
  You're absolutely right — Photoshop can extract signatures. But would you use
  a bulldozer to plant a flower?
</p>
<p>Our app is purpose-built for signature extraction:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One-click detection vs 15 minutes of manual work</li>
  <li>Built-in PDF signing (no need for separate software)</li>
  <li>$29 one-time vs $240/year for Photoshop</li>
  <li>No learning curve vs Photoshop's complexity</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Result:</strong> The same outcome in 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes.
</p>
```

### "Is this better than Adobe?"

```html
<p><strong>"Is this better than Adobe?"</strong></p>
<p>Better is subjective, but here's the objective comparison:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Adobe Acrobat Pro:</strong> PDF editor with basic signature tools
    ($240/year)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Signature Extractor:</strong> Signature specialist with PDF tools
    ($29 lifetime)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you edit PDFs all day, Adobe is better. If you extract signatures and need
  PDF signing, we're better.
</p>
<p>
  Most people need signatures more than general PDF editing — that's why we
  built this.
</p>
```

### "What if it doesn't work?"

```html
<p><strong>"What if it doesn't work for my use case?"</strong></p>
<p>
  We understand the concern. That's why we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.
</p>
<p>
  If Signature Extractor doesn't solve your signature problems, you'll get a
  full refund. No questions asked, no hassle.
</p>
<p>
  We've tested with 1,000+ different document types. If there's a edge case we
  haven't covered, we'll either fix it or refund you.
</p>

## Micro-Copy Guidelines

### Button Text

- Use action verbs: "Get", "Buy", "Download", "Extract"
- Keep under 4 words when possible
- Make the benefit clear: "Lifetime Access" vs "Buy Now"

### Form Labels

- Clear and descriptive: "Email address" not "Email"
- Specify what happens: "Get download link" vs "Submit"

### Tooltips and Help Text

- Anticipate questions: "No credit card required"
- Set expectations: "Average download time: 30 seconds"

### Error Messages

- Be helpful, not scary: "Something went wrong. Please try again."
- Provide next steps: "If problems persist, email support@..."

---

## Localization Considerations

### UK/Australia Spelling

- "Colour" instead of "Color"
- "Optimise" instead of "Optimize"
- "Licence" vs "License" (noun vs verb)

### Currency Display

- USD: "$29"
- EUR: "€29"
- GBP: "£29"
- Include local pricing if selling in those markets

### Regional Pricing

- Consider purchasing power parity
- Display local currency conversion
- Include tax information for EU

_This messaging framework will be refined based on user testing and conversion data._
