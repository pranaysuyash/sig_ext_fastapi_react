## Strategic Positioning

### Current Market Landscape

**Competitors & Pricing:**

- **Adobe Acrobat Pro**: $19.99/mo ($240/year) - Overkill for signatures
- **DocuSign Personal**: $10/mo ($120/year) - Browser-based, no image cleanup
- **Smallpdf Pro**: $12/mo ($144/year) - Web-first, limited control
- **Photoshop + PDF Editor**: $20-30/mo - Requires technical skill

**Our Advantage:**

- One-time $39 payment (or $29 launch price)
- Desktop precision tools (not web-based compromise)
- Complete workflow (extraction + PDF signing)
- Privacy-first (local processing)
- Lifetime updates

### Value Proposition Hierarchy

1. **Primary**: "The only desktop app that extracts clean signatures AND places them on PDFs"
2. **Secondary**: "Own it forever - no subscriptions, no upload anxiety"
3. **Tertiary**: "Built for precision and privacy"
