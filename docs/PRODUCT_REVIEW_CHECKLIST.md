## Where to Find DMGs Locally

**Local builds:**
```bash
# DMGs are created here (if you run hdiutil create):
dist/SignatureExtractor_ARM64.dmg
dist/SignatureExtractor_Intel.dmg

# .app bundles (before DMG creation):
dist/SignatureExtractor.app
dist/SignatureExtractor_Intel.app

# To create DMG manually:
hdiutil create \
  -volname "Signature Extractor" \
  -srcfolder dist/SignatureExtractor.app \
  -ov \
  -format UDZO \
  dist/SignatureExtractor_ARM64.dmg
```

**CI/CD builds:**
- GitHub Actions artifacts: Go to Actions tab → Select workflow run → Download artifacts
- GitHub Releases: `https://github.com/pranaysuyash/sig_ext_fastapi_react/releases`

**Build outputs are gitignored** - never committed to repo, only stored as GitHub Release assets.
