Sorry you're having trouble installing! Here's a quick fix:

1. Right-click the SignatureExtractor app → "Open"
2. Click "Open" again in the security dialog
3. Enter your license key: {license_key}

This bypasses macOS Gatekeeper (common for indie apps).

scroll down and click "Open Anyway" next to Signature Extractor.

Let me know if you're still stuck!

```

```
Hi [Name],

Your license key is: {license_key}

To activate:
1. Open Signature Extractor

The app needs internet once for activation, then works offline.

Still having issues? Send me a screenshot and I'll help debug.
— Pranay
```

**Refund Request:**
```
Hi [Name],

No problem at all — refund processed. You should see it in 3-5 business days.

## Part 11: Gumroad Best Practices (Ongoing)

### 11.1 Product Page Optimization

**A/B Test These Elements (After Launch):**
- Cover image (before/after vs. app screenshot)
- Headline ("Extract signatures" vs. "Sign PDFs faster")
- Price ($39 vs. $49 vs. $29)
- CTA button text ("I want this" vs. "Buy Lifetime License")

**How to A/B Test on Gumroad:**
- Duplicate product → Test variant
- Run for 2 weeks → Compare conversion rates
- Keep winner, archive loser

### 11.2 Email Marketing (Gumroad Built-In)

**Monthly Newsletter to Customers:**
- Announce new features (v1.1, v1.2, etc.)
- Share tips & use cases
- Invite feedback on roadmap
- Promote affiliates ("Earn 20% sharing Signature Extractor")

**Unsubscribe Rate:**
Keep below 2% (industry standard for software)

### 11.3 Gumroad Discover (Organic Traffic)

**Enable Discover After Launch:**
- Gumroad marketplace where users browse products
- Free organic traffic (Gumroad promotes your product)
- Enable: Product settings → Discover → On

**Optimize for Discover:**
- Use relevant tags (productivity, macOS, PDF, signature)
- High-quality cover image (stands out in grid)
- Social proof (ratings, reviews)

### 11.4 Handling Disputes & Chargebacks

**If Customer Files Chargeback:**
1. Gumroad notifies you via email
2. Provide evidence (emails, download logs)
3. Gumroad handles dispute with payment processor

**Chargeback Rate:**
Keep below 1% (anything higher risks payment processor flags)

**Prevention:**
- Clear product description (no surprises)
- Fast support response
- Easy refund process (reduces chargebacks)

## Part 12: Gumroad Alternatives (For Awareness)

You're using Gumroad because Stripe isn't available in India, but here are alternatives to consider later:

**Other Platforms Supporting India:**
1. **Paddle** — Merchant of record (handles tax, EU VAT)
2. **LemonSqueezy** — Similar to Gumroad, better EU support
3. **Payhip** — Lower fees (5% vs Gumroad's 10%)
4. **SendOwl** — Good for digital products

**Why Gumroad is Still Good:**
- Easiest setup (fastest to launch)
- Built-in audience (Discover feature)
- Creator-friendly (no monthly fees on free plan)
- India-friendly (Wise payouts work well)

**When to Switch:**
- If Gumroad fees become too high (>$1000/mo revenue)
- If you need more control (custom checkout, branding)
- If Stripe becomes available in India (migrate to Stripe Checkout)
