## 🎯 THE CORE QUESTION: WHAT'S YOUR CONVERSION RATE?

### **Scenario A: Pay First Model**

- 1,000 people visit Gumroad
- 5% conversion rate = 50 sales
- Revenue: 50 × $29 = **$1,450**

### **Scenario B: Free Download Model**

- 1,000 people download free app
- 10% conversion rate = 100 sales
- Revenue: 100 × $29 = **$2,900**

**Same traffic, double revenue** IF conversion rate doubles.

**But what if conversion rate is lower?**

- 1,000 downloads
- 3% conversion rate = 30 sales
- Revenue: 30 × $29 = **$870** (LESS than pay-first)

## 📊 REALITY CHECK: WHAT'S LIKELY?

### **Desktop Software Conversion Rates**

**Pay-First (Gumroad)**:

- **Expected**: 2-5% conversion
- **Why**: People who seek out and pay for desktop software are serious buyers
- **Psychology**: "I'm already paying, might as well try it"

**Free Download + Trial**:

- **Expected**: 5-15% conversion
- **Why**: Lower barrier to entry, more people try it
- **Psychology**: "Free to try, but I'll pay if it works"

### **Which is Better for $29 Software?**

**For $29 Price Point**:

- Below $30 = impulse buy territory
- People are willing to risk $29
- "Pay first" model works well
- Free download might not add much

**For $99+ Software**:

- "Try before buy" essential
- High price = high risk for buyer
- Free trial critical for conversion

**Your price point ($29) is in a sweet spot where pay-first often works well.**
