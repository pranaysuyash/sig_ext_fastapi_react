## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Give up too early** - Results take 30-90 days  
❌ **Neglect email list** - Your most valuable asset  
❌ **Start with paid ads** - Organic first, paid later  

### Do This Instead:
✅ **Submit 5-10 directories per day** - Sustainable pace  
✅ **Engage authentically** - Build real relationships  
✅ **Share value first** - Help before asking  
✅ **Track everything** - Data drives decisions  
✅ **Be patient** - Compound growth takes time  
✅ **Build email list** - Own your audience
