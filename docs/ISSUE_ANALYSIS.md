# Signature Extractor App - Issue Analysis & Recommendations

## Summary
This document identifies critical issues in the current Signature Extractor App and provides detailed recommendations for fixes and improvements, focusing on the problems identified by the user.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Rotation and Coordinate Mapping Issues

**Problem**: When a saved extracted image is opened, rotated, and a vertical selection is made, parts of the selection get cut off in the preview/result.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `ImageView.rotate_view()` method only applies visual rotation to the view, but the coordinate mapping for selection remains tied to the original image coordinate system
- After rotation, the `selected_rect_image_coords()` method still maps view coordinates to the original image coordinates without accounting for the visual rotation
- When users rotate an image via the `on_rotate()` method, it actually creates a new session with a rotated image, but selection coordinates from the old coordinate system can still cause issues

**Technical Details**:
- `ImageView.selected_rect_image_coords()` uses `mapToScene()` to convert view coordinates to image coordinates
- The visual rotation via `rotate_view()` changes the display but not the coordinate mapping system
- The crop preview and result processing use these coordinates directly, leading to misalignment

### 2. Color Handling Issues

**Problem**: The color wheel selects colors but the result appears black instead of the selected color.

**Root Cause**:
- Most likely caused by the coordinate mapping issues - if coordinates are invalid, the crop operation fails and returns black
- The backend color conversion from hex to BGR is correctly implemented, but if the crop area is wrong, the processing fails

### 3. Backend Coordinate Processing Bug

**Problem**: The backend endpoint processes coordinates after attempting to crop the image, which can cause errors.

**Root Cause**:
- In `extraction.py` process_image_endpoint(), the code does `cropped_image = image[y1:y2, x1:x2]` BEFORE bounds validation
- This can cause IndexError if coordinates are out of bounds
- The bounds checking should happen BEFORE the crop operation

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Coordinate Mapping After Rotation
```python
# In desktop_app/widgets/image_view.py, modify the selected_rect_image_coords method to account for rotation

def selected_rect_image_coords(self) -> tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    """Return selection in image coordinates (x1,y1,x2,y2)."""
    if not self._pixmap_item or self._last_rect.isNull():
        return (0, 0, 0, 0)

    # Map from view coords to scene coords, then to image pixel coords
    top_left = self.mapToScene(self._last_rect.topLeft())
    bottom_right = self.mapToScene(self._last_rect.bottomRight())
    
    # Adjust coordinates based on rotation
    x1, y1 = int(top_left.x()), int(top_left.y())
    x2, y2 = int(bottom_right.x()), int(bottom_right.y())
    
    # Swap x/y if rotated by 90/270 degrees (for visual rotation)
    if self._rotation % 180 == 90:  # rotated 90 or 270 degrees
        # Invert and adjust coordinates for 90/270 degree rotation
        img_width = self._pixmap_item.pixmap().width()
        img_height = self._pixmap_item.pixmap().height()
        # Transform coordinates for rotated view
        # This requires more complex math to properly handle visual rotation
        # For now, ensure proper bounds
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = y1, x1, y2, x2  # placeholder - needs proper implementation
        
    # Clamp to image bounds
    rect = self._pixmap_item.pixmap().rect()
    x1 = max(0, min(x1, rect.width()))
    x2 = max(0, min(x2, rect.width()))
    y1 = max(0, min(y1, rect.height()))
    y2 = max(0, min(y2, rect.height()))
    
    # Ensure x1 < x2 and y1 < y2
    if x1 > x2: x1, x2 = x2, x1
    if y1 > y2: y1, y2 = y2, y1
    
    return (x1, y1, x2, y2)
```

### Fix 2: Better Rotation Integration
```python
# Alternative approach: Instead of visual rotation, update the coordinate mapping
# Modify ImageView to properly handle rotation by maintaining a transformation matrix

def __init__(self, parent=None):
    # ... existing init code ...
    self._rotation = 0  # Track rotation in degrees
    self._rotation_matrix = None  # For coordinate transformations

def rotate_view(self, degrees: float):
    """Rotate view and update rotation tracking."""
    if not self._pixmap_item:
        return
    self.rotate(degrees)
    self._rotation = (self._rotation + degrees) % 360
    # Update transformation matrix for coordinate mapping
    self._update_rotation_matrix()

def _update_rotation_matrix(self):
    """Update the transformation matrix for coordinate mapping."""
    # This would require more complex math to properly map coordinates
    # after visual rotation
    pass
```

### Fix 3: Backend Coordinate Validation (Critical)
```python
# In backend/app/routers/extraction.py, process_image_endpoint method, fix the order:

# Before doing crop operation, validate and fix coordinates
height, width = image.shape[:2]

# Validate coordinates are in correct order and within bounds
x1, x2 = max(0, min(x1, width)), max(0, min(x2, width))
y1, y2 = max(0, min(y1, height)), max(0, min(y2, height))

# Ensure x1 < x2 and y1 < y2
if x1 > x2:
    x1, x2 = x2, x1
if y1 > y2:
    y1, y2 = y2, y1

# Now it's safe to crop
cropped_image = image[y1:y2, x1:x2]

# Additional validation: check if crop area is valid
if cropped_image.size == 0:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid crop area - selection is outside image boundaries")
```

### Fix 4: Improved Frontend Validation
```python
# In desktop_app/views/main_window.py, on_preview method, add coordinate validation:

def on_preview(self):
    # ... existing validation code ...
    
    # Additional validation
    if x1 >= x2 or y1 >= y2:
        QMessageBox.warning(self, "Invalid selection", 
            f"Selection coordinates are invalid: ({x1}, {y1}) to ({x2}, {y2}). Please make sure x1 < x2 and y1 < y2.")
        return
    
    # Check that selection is not too small
    if (x2 - x1) < 2 or (y2 - y1) < 2:
        QMessageBox.warning(self, "Selection too small", 
            "Please select a larger area for extraction.")
        return
```
