# Marketing Plan — Signature Extractor

## Positioning
- Desktop-first signature extraction with precision control and privacy-by-default.
- Stand out with lifetime pricing, offline capability, and pro-grade export options.

## ICPs & Personas
- Legal, real estate, consultants, freelancers/designers, admins processing paper docs.
- Pain: Cleaning signatures for reuse is tedious; web tools feel clunky or privacy-invasive.

## Core Messages
- Instant, precise signature extraction. Private by default. Own it for life.
- Export clean transparent PNGs (and more) in seconds.

## Channels
- Product Hunt + Launch aggregators (BetaList, Indie Hackers)
- Reddit (r/Design, r/legaladviceofftopic), Hacker News (Show HN), relevant Discords/Slack groups
- SEO content hub (how-tos for “extract signature from scan/photo/PDF”)
- YouTube shorts/tutorials showing 30-second workflows
- Partnerships: Real estate coaches, notary communities, paralegal blogs

## Content Strategy
- Pillars: How-to guides, comparison posts (vs Adobe/DocuSign workflows), case studies, “troubleshooting signatures from phone pics”
- Cadence: 2 posts/week for 8 weeks; 1 tutorial video/week
- Lead magnets: Free template pack (email signatures), “Signature extraction checklist” PDF
