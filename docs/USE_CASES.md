**Users**: Real estate agents, title companies, mortgage brokers

---

### 13. **API Integration for SaaS Platforms**

**Problem**: Document management SaaS (e.g., PandaDoc, Proposify) wants to offer signature extraction as a feature.

**How Signature Extractor Helps**:

- REST API integration: `POST /extraction/upload` + `/process_image/`
- Webhook support for async processing
- Return signature PNG + bbox coordinates + metadata JSON
- White-label option for enterprise clients

**Users**: SaaS product teams, no-code platform builders (Bubble, Webflow with backend)

## Advanced/Future Use Cases

### 16. **Handwriting Style Transfer**

- Extract signature and train AI model to generate "variants" of same signature (different pen pressure, slant)
- Use in digital art or personalized stationery

### 17. **Signature Forgery Detection**

- Extract signatures from multiple documents
- Use ML model to detect anomalies (inconsistent stroke patterns)
- Alert fraud investigation teams

### 18. **Multi-Language OCR + Signature**

- Extract signatures from documents with non-Latin scripts (Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic)
- OCR recognizes signatory name in native script
- Export signature + name in UTF-8 JSON

### 19. **Voice-to-Signature (Accessibility)**

- User dictates name → AI generates handwritten-style signature
- Extract and refine using Signature Extractor
- For users with motor disabilities

### 20. **Blockchain-Verified Signatures**

- Extract signature → hash with SHA-256 → store hash on blockchain (Ethereum, Polygon)
- Immutable proof of original signature for legal disputes

### 21. **Seal/Stamp Separation (Signature vs Seal)**

- For documents that contain both a round/seal stamp and a handwritten signature:
  - Remove seal while preserving signature (or the inverse)
  - Techniques: hue/saturation masking (target colored seals), Hough Circle Transform to detect round stamps, color deconvolution to separate ink vs stamp pigment, morphological cleanup
  - Output: Two layers — isolated signature (transparent PNG) and isolated seal (transparent PNG)

### 22. **Digital Signature From Scanned Ink**

- Convert a scanned wet-ink signature into a reusable digital signature asset:
  - Denoise, threshold, vectorize (optional SVG via potrace), set uniform baseline and padding
  - Export profile with recommended sizes for email, PDFs, and print
  - Optionally auto-generate light/dark variants and brand-colored versions

### 23. **Verifiable Signatures (Crypto/Audit)**

- Pair extracted signature with cryptographic attestations:
  - Create a signed hash (SHA-256) of the signature PNG and embed in PDF metadata or a sidecar JSON
  - Optionally: timestamp authority (RFC 3161) or blockchain anchoring for immutability
  - Provide a small verifier script to check integrity against the embedded hash
