### Name
SignKit

### Short Description (One sentence)
Privacy-first desktop app that extracts signatures from documents and signs PDFs offline without cloud upload or subscriptions.


### Full Description (300+ words)

SignKit is a privacy-first desktop application designed for professionals, freelancers, and small businesses who need to extract signatures from documents and sign PDFs without compromising their privacy or paying recurring subscription fees.

**What Makes SignKit Different**

Unlike cloud-based e-signature platforms like DocuSign or Adobe Sign, SignKit runs entirely on your computer. Your documents and signatures never leave your device, making it ideal for handling sensitive contracts, legal documents, and confidential agreements. There's no monthly subscription—just a one-time $29 purchase that you own forever.

**Core Features**

SignKit's signature extraction capability is unique in the market. Upload any image or scanned document containing a signature, use the intuitive selection tool to isolate the signature region, adjust the threshold and color settings, and export a clean, transparent PNG ready to use anywhere. The app includes advanced image processing controls including zoom, pan, rotation, and morphological operations to ensure perfect extraction every time.

The integrated PDF signing workflow lets you open any PDF document, select signatures from your library, place them precisely where needed with drag-and-drop positioning and resizing, and save the signed PDF—all without uploading to the cloud. The app maintains a comprehensive audit log of all PDF operations for compliance and record-keeping.

**Privacy & Security**

SignKit is built with privacy as the foundation. All image processing happens locally using OpenCV and PIL. Your files are never uploaded to external servers. The app works completely offline after installation, requiring no internet connection for core functionality. This makes it GDPR and HIPAA friendly, perfect for regulated industries.

**Technical Excellence**

Built with Python and PySide6 (Qt), SignKit delivers a native desktop experience on macOS, Windows, and Linux. The hybrid architecture includes an optional local FastAPI backend for advanced features, but degrades gracefully if unavailable. The app includes multi-layer security validation, secure file handling, and automatic cleanup of temporary files.

**Pricing & Availability**

SignKit costs $29 as a one-time purchase with no recurring fees. The trial version includes full functionality except export and save operations, allowing you to test thoroughly before buying. Available for macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon), Windows 10/11, and Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora).

**Perfect For**

- Freelancers and consultants who sign contracts regularly
- Small businesses handling NDAs and agreements
- Legal professionals requiring document confidentiality
- Privacy-conscious individuals and organizations
- Anyone tired of subscription fees for basic PDF signing

SignKit represents a new category: privacy-first document tools that respect your data, your budget, and your workflow.

**Transform How You Handle Signatures and PDFs**

SignKit is a revolutionary desktop application that solves two critical problems for modern professionals: extracting clean signatures from documents and signing PDFs securely—all without compromising your privacy or breaking the bank with subscription fees.

**The Signature Extraction Problem**

Every professional has faced this: you have a signature on a scanned document, contract, or photo, and you need to extract it cleanly for reuse. Traditional tools require complex image editing skills or expensive software. SignKit makes this trivial with its intuitive signature extraction workflow.

Simply upload your image, use the click-and-drag selection tool to isolate the signature region, adjust the threshold slider to remove background noise, choose your signature color, and export a clean, transparent PNG in seconds. The app includes professional-grade controls: zoom up to 500%, pan across large documents, rotate images, and fine-tune morphological operations for perfect results every time.

**Privacy-First PDF Signing**

Unlike cloud-based e-signature platforms that upload your sensitive documents to external servers, SignKit runs entirely on your computer. Open any PDF, select a signature from your library, place it with pixel-perfect precision using drag-and-drop positioning and resizing handles, and save the signed PDF—all without an internet connection.

This offline-first architecture makes SignKit ideal for:
- Legal professionals handling confidential client documents
- Healthcare providers managing HIPAA-compliant forms
- Financial advisors signing sensitive agreements
- Government contractors with security clearance requirements
- Any organization that values data sovereignty

- **Professional PDF Tools**: Multi-page support, page navigation, precise signature placement, bulk signing across multiple pages
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail of all PDF operations with timestamps and user identification for compliance
- **Multi-Pane Workflow**: Source, preview, and result panes with independent zoom and pan controls for efficient processing
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Full keyboard control for power users with shortcuts for all common operations
- **Native Desktop Experience**: Built with Qt for native look and feel on macOS, Windows, and Linux

**Technical Excellence & Security**

SignKit is built on a robust technical foundation:
- Multi-layer file validation prevents security vulnerabilities
- Secure temporary file handling with automatic cleanup
- Memory-efficient processing handles large documents
- No telemetry or analytics—your usage data stays private
- GDPR and HIPAA friendly architecture
- Regular security audits and updates

**Pricing That Makes Sense**

Tired of paying $10-20 per month for basic PDF signing? SignKit costs $29 as a one-time purchase. Own it forever. No recurring fees. No feature limitations. No user limits. Just straightforward, honest pricing.

The trial version includes full functionality except export and save operations, so you can thoroughly test the app before purchasing. This try-before-you-buy model ensures you know exactly what you're getting.

**Cross-Platform Availability**

SignKit runs natively on:
- macOS 11.0+ (Big Sur and later) - Universal binary for Intel and Apple Silicon
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Fedora 35+) - AppImage, .deb, and .rpm packages

Hey everyone! I'm Pranay, the maker of SignKit.

I'm here all day to answer questions, take feedback, and hear what features you'd want next!

Some things I'm curious about:
