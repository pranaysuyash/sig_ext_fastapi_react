Title: Soft launching SignKit - privacy-first signature extraction ($29)

Hey r/[subreddit]!

After 6 months of development, I'm soft launching SignKit - a desktop app 
that extracts signatures from documents with complete privacy.

**Why I built it:**
Needed to extract signatures for contracts but didn't want to upload 
sensitive documents to cloud services. Existing tools either compromised 
privacy or cost $240/year.

**What it does:**
• Extract signatures from any document (PDF, JPG, PNG)
• Precision selection with zoom controls
• Export as clean, transparent PNG
• Place signatures directly on PDFs
• 100% local processing (privacy-first)

**Tech stack:**
• Python + Qt for desktop UI
• OpenCV for image processing
• PyMuPDF for PDF handling
• Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)

**Early adopter pricing:** $29 one-time (no subscription)

Would love your feedback: https://signkit.work

Happy to answer any questions!

Hey HN!

I built SignKit - a desktop app for extracting signatures from documents

privacy or cost $240/year (Adobe).

**What it does:**
• Extract signatures from any document (PDF, JPG, PNG)
• Precision selection with zoom/pan controls
• Export as clean, transparent PNG
• Place signatures directly on PDFs
• 100% local processing (no cloud uploads)

**Tech stack:**
• Python + Qt for desktop UI
• OpenCV for image processing
• PyMuPDF for PDF handling
• PyInstaller for distribution

**Black Friday special:** $19 (35% off regular $29)

Free trial available - test all features before buying.

Demo: [YouTube link]
Landing page: https://signkit.work

Would love your feedback on the approach and implementation!

🚀 Excited to launch SignKit for Black Friday!

After 6 months of development, I'm launching a privacy-first tool for 
extracting signatures from documents.

Legal professionals, healthcare providers, and business owners handle 
sensitive documents daily. Cloud-based tools expose this data to 
potential breaches.

SignKit processes everything locally on your computer. Your documents 
never leave your device.

✨ Perfect for:
• Contract management
• Document signing workflows
• Medical form processing
• Real estate transactions

💰 Black Friday Special:
35% OFF - Just $19 (regularly $29)
