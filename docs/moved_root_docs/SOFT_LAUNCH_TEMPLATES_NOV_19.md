## 🌐 INDIE HACKERS POST

**Title:** `🚀 Launched SignKit - Privacy-first signature extraction tool`

**Body:**

```markdown
Hey Indie Hackers! 👋

Just launched SignKit after 6 months of development. Would love your feedback!

**What it is:**
Privacy-first signature extraction tool. All processing happens locally on your
computer - no cloud uploads, no tracking.

**Why I built it:**
Needed to extract signatures for contracts but didn't trust cloud services with
sensitive documents. Existing tools either compromised privacy or cost $240/year.

**Tech Stack:**
• Python + Qt for desktop UI
• OpenCV for image processing
• PyMuPDF for PDF handling
• Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)

**Features:**
• Extract signatures from any document (PDF, JPG, PNG)
• Precision selection with zoom controls
• Export as clean, transparent PNG
• Place signatures directly on PDFs
• 100% local processing

**Business Model:**
One-time payment ($29), no subscriptions. Early adopter pricing available.

**Current Status:**
✅ Desktop app built for all platforms
✅ Landing page live at https://signkit.work
✅ Available on Gumroad
🔜 Black Friday launch on Product Hunt (Nov 28)

**What I'd love feedback on:**
1. Is the value proposition clear?
2. Pricing - too high/low/just right?
3. What features would make you buy?
4. Any concerns or questions?

Happy to answer any questions! 🚀

## 📱 REDDIT POST - r/SideProject

**Title:** `Soft launching SignKit - privacy-first signature extraction ($29)`

**Body:**

```markdown
Hey r/SideProject!

After 6 months of development, I'm soft launching SignKit - a desktop app that
extracts signatures from documents with complete privacy.

**Why I built it:**
Needed to extract signatures for contracts but didn't want to upload sensitive
documents to cloud services. Existing tools either compromised privacy or cost
$240/year (Adobe).

**What it does:**
• Extract signatures from any document (PDF, JPG, PNG)
• Precision selection with zoom controls
• Export as clean, transparent PNG
• Place signatures directly on PDFs
• 100% local processing (privacy-first)

**Tech stack:**
• Python + Qt for desktop UI
• OpenCV for image processing
• PyMuPDF for PDF handling
• Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)

**Early adopter pricing:** $29 one-time (no subscription)

**What I learned building this:**
1. Desktop apps are hard but users value privacy
2. PyInstaller packaging is... challenging
3. Balancing features vs simplicity is tough
4. Local processing is a HUGE selling point

**Next steps:**
• Gather feedback from this soft launch
• Product Hunt launch on Black Friday (Nov 28)
• Add auto-detection features based on feedback

Would love your honest feedback: https://signkit.work

Happy to answer any questions!

**Demo:** [Will add YouTube link when video is ready]

## 💼 LINKEDIN POST (Professional Audience)

**Post:**

```
🚀 Excited to launch SignKit today!

After 6 months of development, I'm launching a privacy-first tool for extracting
signatures from documents.

🔒 Why Privacy Matters:
Legal professionals, healthcare providers, and business owners handle sensitive
documents daily. Cloud-based tools expose this data to potential breaches.

SignKit processes everything locally on your computer. Your documents never leave
your device.

✨ Perfect for:
• Contract management
• Document signing workflows
• Medical form processing
• Real estate transactions

💰 Business Model:
One-time payment ($29), no subscriptions. Customers own it forever.

🎯 Target Launch:
• Soft launch this week (gathering feedback)
• Product Hunt launch on Black Friday (Nov 28)
• Goal: 200-500 early adopters

Try it: https://signkit.work

Would love to hear your thoughts! What features would make this valuable for your
workflow?
