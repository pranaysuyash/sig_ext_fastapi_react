## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID TODAY

### Don't:
❌ **Spend hours perfecting copy** - Good enough is good enough. Ship it.
❌ **Wait for everything to be perfect** - Nothing is perfect. Launch now.
❌ **Ignore comments** - Every comment deserves a response within 30 min.
❌ **Be salesy** - Be helpful and authentic, not pushy.
❌ **Give up if early response is slow** - It takes time. Keep posting.
❌ **Forget to document** - Write down metrics, feedback, lessons learned.

### Do:
✅ **Ship fast** - Get posts out there quickly
✅ **Respond faster** - Be the fastest responder in every thread
✅ **Be authentic** - Share your real story, challenges, lessons
✅ **Ask for feedback** - People love giving advice
✅ **Thank everyone** - Gratitude goes a long way
✅ **Document everything** - Metrics, feedback, what worked/didn't
