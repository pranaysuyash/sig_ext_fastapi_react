## 💰 Pricing Strategy

**Launch Pricing:**
- $29 lifetime license (launch promotion)
- $39 lifetime license (post-launch standard)
- No subscription model initially

**Rationale:**
- Low barrier to entry
- Viral potential (people share good deals)
- Builds customer base quickly
- Can introduce subscription tier later for advanced features

## 📈 Unit Economics

**Target Metrics:**
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $10-30
- Lifetime Value (LTV): $29-39
- LTV:CAC Ratio: 1.5-3.0x
- Payback Period: Immediate (one-time purchase)

**Channel Economics:**
- SEO/Content: $0-5 CAC (mostly time investment)
- Product Hunt: $5-15 CAC
- Reddit: $0-10 CAC (organic engagement)
- Bing Ads: $15-25 CAC
- Retargeting: $10-20 CAC
- Affiliates: $8-12 CAC (30% commission)

## 🎯 Growth Levers

1. **Organic Traffic** (SEO/Content) - Highest margin, longest lag
2. **Product Hunt Launch** - One-time spike, builds momentum
3. **Affiliate Program** - Scalable, performance-based
4. **Retargeting Ads** - High conversion, limited scale
5. **Bing Ads** - Profitable at scale, B2B audience

## ⚠️ Key Risks

**Market Risks:**
- Competition from free tools
- Market size smaller than expected
- Privacy concerns less important to users

**Execution Risks:**
- SEO takes longer than 6 months
- Product Hunt launch underperforms
- Paid ads unprofitable at $29 price

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Focus on privacy-first positioning (unique)
- Build organic channels first (lower risk)
- Test paid channels with small budgets
- Consider subscription tier if needed
