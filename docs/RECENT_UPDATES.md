# What Just Shipped — Immediate UX Fixes

## Problems Solved

### 1. Selection vs Pan Conflict ✅

**Issue**: When zoomed in, left-click tried to both select and pan, causing erratic behavior.

**Solution**:

- Added "Mode: Select" / "Mode: Pan" toggle button
- Selection mode (default): Left-click draws selection rectangle
- Pan mode: Left-click drags the view
- Middle-click always pans regardless of mode

**How to Use**: Click "Mode: Select" button to switch between modes, or use middle-mouse-button to pan anytime.

### 2. Image Orientation Fixed ✅

**Issue**: Photos taken on phone appeared rotated in the app (vertical image showed as horizontal).

**Solution**:

- Added EXIF metadata reading on image load
- Auto-rotates images based on camera orientation tag (0x0112)
- Handles all standard orientations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)
- Falls back to basic loading if EXIF parsing fails

**Result**: Source view now matches the image orientation you see in your photo viewer.

### 3. Preview/Result Panes Hidden Until Selection ✅

**Issue**: Preview and result areas took up screen space before any selection was made.

**Solution**:

- Crop preview and result panes start hidden
- Source view gets full window initially
- Panes appear automatically when you make a selection
- Hide again when selection is cleared

**Result**: More room to see and select from the source image.

### 4. Result Visibility Improved ✅

**Issue**: Transparent PNG output was hard to see against dark gray background.

**Solution**:

- Result view now has white background
- Crop preview also has white background with subtle border
- Transparency is now clearly visible (white shows through transparent areas)

**Result**: Much easier to see your extracted signature.

## What to Test

1. **Upload a vertical photo** (from phone):
   - Should appear correctly oriented in source view
2. **Zoom in (Ctrl+wheel or + button)**:
   - Click "Mode: Pan" button
   - Left-click-drag to pan around
   - Click "Mode: Select" button
   - Left-click-drag to make selection
3. **Make a selection**:
   - Preview and result panes should appear
   - Crop preview shows your selection on white background
   - Adjust threshold/color → result updates automatically
4. **Clear selection**:
   - Panes hide again
   - Full window for source view

## What's Next (Priority Order)

1. **Icons & Visual Polish** (1-2 hours)

   - Add emoji or QIcon to buttons (+, −, ↶, ↷)
   - Set app window icon
   - Optional: subtle color theme (blue accent for buttons)

2. **Rotate Buttons** (2-3 hours)

   - Add "Rotate ↶" and "Rotate ↷" buttons
   - Client rotates image in-memory
   - Re-uploads as new session
   - Updates source view

3. **Export Metadata** (1 hour)

   - "Export Metadata" button
   - Saves JSON with selection bbox, color, threshold, timestamp
   - Saves alongside PNG with same base filename

4. **REST API Docs** (1 hour)

   - Create `docs/API.md`
   - Document endpoints for browser extension developers
   - Include curl examples

5. **Auto-Detection Research** (4-6 hours)
   - Prototype contour-based signature detection
   - Test on 10-20 sample documents
   - Document accuracy and edge cases

**Questions? Issues?**  
Check the image attached showing your vertical document—confirm it loads correctly oriented now, and test the mode toggle when zoomed in.
