# EP01 — Why Signature Extraction Shouldn’t Be a Chore in 2025

[Soft intro sting]

Hook (25s)
If you’ve ever photographed your signature and fought that stubborn white box… you’re not alone. This show is for busy professionals who want a clean, transparent signature — without wrestling with layers, masks, or online tools. In minutes, not hours.

Context (60s)
Signature Extractor is a native Mac app that runs entirely on your computer. No uploads, no waiting, no privacy trade-offs. It uses smart thresholding to isolate ink from paper and exports a crisp PNG with transparency you can drop into PDFs, proposals, or invoices.

Key Insights (3–5)

1. Simplicity: Drag, select, extract. That’s it. The app handles the rest.
2. Quality: True transparency — not gray halos or patchy edges.
3. Control: Adjust threshold and color, and rotate before export.
4. Reuse: Save signatures to a built-in library for one-click exports later.
5. Own it: One-time price. Offline by design. Apple Silicon and Intel builds.

Practical Tips (3)

- Capture well: If photographing, use indirect daylight, place the paper on a dark surface, and avoid shadows.
- Scan smart: 300 DPI is ideal. Pen ink with good contrast (dark blue or black) improves edges.
- Tune lightly: Start with the default threshold; nudge up/down only if edges look fuzzy or faint.

Outro (10s)
This episode was produced with NotebookLM, grounded in our docs. I’m your host — and I want you spending time signing deals, not cleaning pixels.
