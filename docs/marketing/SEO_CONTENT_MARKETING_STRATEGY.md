- Goal: 500 visitors, 10 sales
- Investment: $500-1,500/month

**Months 4-6: Traction**

- Goal: 2,000 visitors, 50 sales
- Investment: $1,000-2,500/month

**Months 7-12: Growth**

- Investment: $1,500-3,500/month

**Months 13-24: Dominance**
- Focus: Maintain rankings, expand keywords
- Goal: 40,000 visitors, 800 sales
- Investment: $2,000-4,000/month (profitable)

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. Consistency (publish 3x/week minimum)
2. Quality over quantity (thorough, helpful content)
3. Bottom-funnel first (conversion over traffic)
4. Distribution (don't just publish and hope)
5. Link building (authority matters)
6. Patience (SEO takes 4-6 months to work)

**The Bottom Line:**
SEO and content marketing will drive 50-70% of SignKit's sales by Month 12. It requires patience, consistency, and quality execution, but the ROI compounds over time. Unlike paid ads that stop when you stop paying, organic content becomes a permanent asset that generates sales for years.

Start today. Publish consistently. Build authority. Win organic traffic.
