## 2. AFFILIATE PROGRAM STRATEGY

### Should SignKit Have an Affiliate Program?

**YES - Strong Recommendation**

**Why:**
- Low customer acquisition cost (only pay for results)

- Build word-of-mouth network
- 15-20% of indie SaaS sales from affiliates
- $29 price point is affiliate-friendly (easier to promote than $99+)

---

### Commission Structure Recommendations

**Option 1: Percentage-Based (Recommended)**
- **30% commission** on first sale
- Rationale: $8.70 payout on $29 sale is attractive

**Option 2: Flat Fee**
- **$10 per sale**
- Simpler for affiliates to understand
- Predictable payout
- Less attractive than percentage for high-volume affiliates

**Option 3: Tiered (Advanced)**
- 0-10 sales: 25% commission
- 11-50 sales: 30% commission
- 51+ sales: 35% commission
- Incentivizes volume affiliates

**Recommended:** Start with Option 1 (30% on all sales), move to Option 3 after 6-12 months

## SUMMARY: The Partnership Playbook

**Partnerships will drive 20-30% of SignKit revenue** by focusing on:

1. **Affiliates** (easiest, fastest ROI)
2. **API + Zapier** (foundation for all integrations)
3. **Cloud storage** (Dropbox, Drive, OneDrive)
4. **Industry-specific** (Clio for legal, DotLoop for RE)
5. **Associations** (credibility + member access)

**Critical Path:**
- Week 1: Launch affiliate program
- Month 1-3: Recruit 30-50 affiliates
- Month 2-4: Build API
- Month 4-6: Launch Zapier + cloud integrations
- Month 6-12: Industry-specific integrations
- Month 12+: Scale and optimize

**Investment:** $25,000-60,000 over 18 months
**Expected ROI:** 4:1 to 8:1
**Partnership Revenue:** $15,000-50,000 in Year 1, $60,000-200,000 in Year 2

Start with affiliates (low cost, high ROI), build API foundation, then expand to high-value integrations.
