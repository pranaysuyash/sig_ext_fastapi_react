**What Will Work:**
- SEO & Content (50-70% of sales, 4-6 month lag)
- Product Hunt (single best launch platform)
- Reddit (authentic engagement)
- Affiliates (20-30% of revenue)
- Retargeting Ads (11.4% conversion)
- Bing Ads (42% cheaper than Google)

**What Won't Work:**
- LinkedIn Ads (too expensive at $29 price)
- Cold Facebook/Instagram Ads (poor ROI)
- YouTube Ads (awareness only)
- Paid-only strategy (unprofitable)

**The Opportunity:**
Privacy-first positioning is wide open. No major player owns "offline signature extraction" or "privacy-first PDF signing."
