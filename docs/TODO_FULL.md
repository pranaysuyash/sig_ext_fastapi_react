# Full Launch Roadmap

This document mirrors the full backlog we've been tracking. It's grouped by area and uses statuses: [x] done • [~] in progress • [ ] pending • [s] skip/later.

**Progress: 18 done / 6 in-progress / 13 pending / 3 skip-for-now**

Legend:

- Top 10 Launch = must-have for initial release
- Next Phase = implement after launch if needed
- [s] = skip for first release (defer to v2 or optional)
