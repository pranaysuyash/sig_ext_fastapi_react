# Help & Troubleshooting

This guide covers common questions and quick fixes for the desktop app.

## Quick Answers

- Clean Viewport vs Clear Selection
  - Clear Selection: removes the current rubberâ€‘band and hides preview/result panes.
  - Clean Viewport: clears source/preview/result panes, resets session id, and disables dependent actions until a new upload.

- Source Rotate vs Preview/Result Rotate
  - Source rotate reâ€‘uploads a rotated image (new session) and clears selection because coordinates change.
  - Preview/Result rotate is viewâ€‘only for display; it does not change underlying pixels.

- Rotationâ€‘Aware Selection
  - Selections survive zoom/pan/fit/resize/rotation. The app stores the 4 selection corners in scene space and maps a normalized bounding box back to image pixels.
  - See Coordinate Mapping for details.

- Zoom % and Fit
  - Use the editable Zoom % combo (e.g., 125%, 50%) or choose Fit to scale the image to the active pane.
  - Reset Viewport returns the active pane to default zoom, pan, and rotation.

- Footer vs Console Logs
  - Footer shows: Viewport size, Image size, Visible bounds, Zoom %, Rotation Â°, Selection box.
  - After this update, the numbers match because mapping uses sceneâ€‘space bounds (rotationâ€‘aware) and clamping.

## Common Issues

- My photo is rotated; should I rotate before selecting?
  - Yes. Rotate the source if the image is misâ€‘oriented, then make your selection. Source rotation reâ€‘uploads a corrected image and resets the selection.

- I donâ€™t see the preview/result panes
  - They only appear after a valid selection (nonâ€‘zero area). Use Selection mode (ðŸŽ¯) to draw a box.

- Zooming makes coordinates look off
  - Coordinates are always reported in image pixels. Zoom or Fit only affects display scale. If you suspect a mismatch, try Reset Viewport and confirm Visible bounds updates as expected.

- Threshold Auto/Manual
  - Toggling Auto disables the slider and computes a selectionâ€‘specific threshold. Switch back to manual to fineâ€‘tune.

- Backend isnâ€™t responding
  - Ensure FastAPI is running on 127.0.0.1:8001. Health check: http://127.0.0.1:8001/health

If you still have issues, capture a screenshot of the footer metrics and your console output and include your OS + steps to reproduce.
