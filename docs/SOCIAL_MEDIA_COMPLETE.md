### Account Setup:

      Ex-EY | AI/ML | Bangalore 🇮🇳

### Content Strategy:

**Daily Posting Schedule:**

### Tweet Types & Templates:

#### 1. Progress Updates (Daily)
```
Day 15 of building SignKit:

✅ Extracted 1,000+ signatures today
✅ Optimized CV algorithm (now <1s)
✅ Fixed Mac M1 compatibility bug
⏳ Working on: Batch processing

Building in public. Follow along 👇
#buildinpublic #indiehackers
```

#### 2. Metrics/Revenue (Weekly)
```
Week 3 of SignKit:

💰 Revenue: $870 (+45% vs last week)
👥 Customers: 30 (+12)
📥 Trials: 156 (+34)
🌍 Countries: 12 (+3)

What worked:
• Product Hunt launch
• Reddit r/privacy post
• Honest pricing page

What didn't:
• Paid ads (terrible ROI)

AMA 👇
```

#### 3. Lessons Learned (2-3x/week)
```
Lesson from building SignKit:

Don't compete on features.
Compete on positioning.

DocuSign has 100+ features.
SignKit has 5.

But SignKit is:
• 10x cheaper ($29 vs $300/year)
• 10x faster (<1s vs 30s)
• 100% private (local vs cloud)

Find your angle. Own it.
```

#### 4. Behind-the-Scenes (2-3x/week)
```
3 AM debugging session:

The bug: Signatures extracted perfectly on Mac, 
failed on Windows.

The cause: File path separators (/ vs \)

The fix: 2 lines of code.

The lesson: Test on all platforms BEFORE launch.

Cost me 8 hours and 3 refunds. 😅
```

#### 5. Controversial/Hot Takes (1-2x/week)
```
Unpopular opinion:

Subscription software is a scam for simple tools.

You don't need $25/month for:
• PDF signing
• Screenshot tools
• Note-taking apps
• To-do lists

One-time pricing is coming back.

And I'm here for it. 🔥
```

#### 6. Polls (1-2x/week)
```
Quick poll for freelancers/consultants:

How much do you spend annually on e-signature software?

🔘 $0 (use free tools)
🔘 $1-100
🔘 $100-300
🔘 $300+

Trying to validate SignKit's $29 pricing 👇
```

#### 7. Threads (2-3x/week)
```
I analyzed 50 DocuSign alternatives.

Here's what I learned about competing with a $5B company:

🧵 Thread 👇

1/ Don't try to match features.

DocuSign has 100+ features built over 20 years.
You can't compete there.

Instead, find what they CAN'T do...

2/ Privacy is DocuSign's weakness.

Every document uploads to their cloud.
Legal, medical, financial - all on their servers.

SignKit processes 100% locally.
Documents never leave your device.

3/ Pricing is their other weakness...

[Continue thread with 8-10 tweets]
```

#### 8. Engagement Tweets (Daily)
```
What's the #1 feature you wish [category] software had?

For me with e-signature tools, it was:
• Offline capability
• No per-document fees
• Signature library management

What am I missing? 👇
```

#### 9. Milestone Celebrations (As they happen)
```
🎉 SignKit just hit $10,000 in revenue!

30 days from launch to $10K.

Breakdown:
• 345 customers
• $29 average
• 3.2% conversion rate
• $12 CAC

All bootstrapped. No VC. No ads.

Just:
• Product Hunt
• Reddit
• Twitter
• Honest pricing

Thank you all 🙏

What should I build next? 👇
```

#### 10. Customer Stories (2-3x/week)
```
Customer email that made my day:

"I was paying DocuSign $40/month for 2 years.
That's $960.

SignKit cost me $29 once.

You just saved me $931. Thank you."

This is why I build. 🙏

## 💼 LINKEDIN STRATEGY (SECONDARY PLATFORM)

### Why LinkedIn for SignKit:
- B2B audience (freelancers, consultants, legal professionals)
- Professional credibility
- Viral potential (algorithm favors personal posts)
- Less noisy than Twitter
- Higher-intent audience

### Profile Optimization:

**Headline:**
```
Founder @ SignKit | Building Privacy-First PDF Signature Software | 
Ex-EY Consultant | AI/ML Engineer
```

**About Section:**
```
I'm building SignKit - a desktop-first alternative to DocuSign that 
processes signatures locally on your device.

Why? I was tired of:
• Uploading sensitive contracts to cloud services
• Paying $300+/year for basic features
• Waiting 30+ seconds for cloud processing

SignKit extracts signatures in <1 second, works 100% offline, and 
costs $29 once (not $300/year).

Currently serving freelancers, legal professionals, and healthcare 
providers who value privacy and predictable pricing.

Previously: Data Science Consultant @ Ernst & Young
Currently: Co-Founder @ MedPiper Technologies

Tech: Python, OpenCV, Computer Vision, AI/ML, NLP

**Featured Section:**
- SignKit website
- Product Hunt launch
- Best blog posts
- Case studies
- Media mentions

### Content Strategy:

**Posting Frequency:**
- 3-5 posts per week (less than Twitter)
- Quality over quantity
- Longer-form content (1,000-3,000 characters)

**Best Times:**
- Tuesday-Thursday
- 8-10 AM or 12-2 PM (EST)
- Avoid weekends

### LinkedIn Post Types:

#### 1. Founder Journey (Weekly)
```
30 days of building SignKit in public:

I quit my consulting job to build a DocuSign alternative.

Here's what happened:

💰 Revenue: $10,000
👥 Customers: 345
🌍 Countries: 23
⭐ Rating: 4.8/5

But the numbers don't tell the full story...

[Continue with detailed story - 1,500 words]

What I learned:
1. Solve your own problem first
2. Privacy-first positioning resonates
3. One-time pricing stands out
4. Desktop apps aren't dead
5. Community > advertising

Questions? Ask below 👇

#entrepreneurship #saas #startup #buildinpublic
```

#### 2. Business Insights (2x/week)
```
I analyzed 50 SaaS pricing pages.

Here's what converts:

❌ What doesn't work:
• Hidden pricing
• "Contact us" buttons
• Complex tiers
• Annual-only plans

✅ What works:
• Transparent pricing
• Clear value prop
• Simple tiers (1-3 max)
• Monthly + annual options
• Money-back guarantee

SignKit's pricing page converts at 3.2%.

Industry average: 1-2%.

The difference? Radical transparency.

What's your conversion rate? 👇

```

#### 3. Technical Deep-Dives (1x/week)
```
How I built signature extraction that's 10x faster than DocuSign:

Technical breakdown 🧵

The Challenge:
DocuSign takes 30+ seconds to extract a signature.
Why? Cloud round-trip + server processing.

The Solution:
Local processing with OpenCV.

The Stack:
• Python 3.11
• OpenCV 4.8
• PySide6 (Qt)
• Custom CV algorithms

The Process:
1. PDF → Image conversion (0.1s)
2. Contour detection (0.2s)
3. Signature isolation (0.3s)
4. Quality enhancement (0.2s)
5. PNG export (0.2s)

Total: <1 second

The Result:
• 30x faster than cloud alternatives
• 100% private (no uploads)
• Works offline
• Consistent performance

The Lesson:
Sometimes the "old" way (desktop apps) is better than 
the "new" way (cloud everything).

Questions about the tech? Ask below 👇

```

#### 4. Controversial Opinions (1x/week)
```
Unpopular opinion:

Most SaaS businesses should be one-time purchases.

Here's why:

1. Subscription fatigue is real
Users are tired of $10/month × 20 services = $200/month

2. Simple tools don't need subscriptions
PDF signing, screenshot tools, note apps - these don't 
require ongoing server costs

3. One-time pricing builds trust
"We're not trying to extract maximum lifetime value.
We're trying to solve your problem once."

4. It's more honest
If your tool doesn't require ongoing development or 
server costs, why charge monthly?

SignKit: $29 once
DocuSign: $300/year

Same core functionality.
Different business model.

Agree or disagree? 👇

#saas #pricing #business #entrepreneurship
```

#### 5. Customer Success Stories (2x/week)
```
Customer story that validates everything:

Sarah, a freelance designer, was paying DocuSign $25/month.

She signed 3-4 contracts per month.

That's $8.33 per signature.

Over 2 years: $600.

She bought SignKit for $29.

Her words:
"I'll never pay for e-signature software again. 
This paid for itself in the first month."

This is why I build.

Not for VC funding.
Not for unicorn status.
Not for acquisition.

For moments like this.

When you genuinely improve someone's life.

That's the win. 🙏
