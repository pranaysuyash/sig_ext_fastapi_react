- 1 Enterprise account = $500/mo
- **Monthly Revenue**: $4,400
- **Annual Revenue**: ~$52,800

### Optimistic Scenario
- 5,000 Free users
- 500 Pro users √ó $12 = $6,000/mo

## Pricing Psychology

### Why $12/month for Pro?
- **Below competition**: DocuSign ($25), Adobe Sign ($30) ‚Üí Signature Extractor feels like a steal
- **Impulse-friendly**: Under $15 triggers "low-friction" purchase decision
- **Annual incentive**: $120/year = $10/mo ‚Üí 17% discount encourages commitment

### Why $30/user for Team?
- **Volume discount**: 3+ users = $90/mo total (cheaper than 3 Pro users at $36/mo if they didn't have team features)
- **B2B expectation**: Teams expect to pay $20-50/user/mo for SaaS tools
- **Margin for sales**: Room for 20-30% discounts for larger teams

### Why Custom for Enterprise?
- **Value-based pricing**: Large orgs have bigger budgets and need custom features
- **Negotiation leverage**: "Starts at $500" anchors the conversation high
- **Relationship-building**: Custom contracts allow for long-term partnerships and upsells

## Pricing Evolution (Future)

### Year 2-3: Introduce New Tiers

- **Premium ($25/mo)**: Above Pro ‚Äî includes OCR, auto-detection, priority rendering
- **Team Plus ($50/user)**: Above Team ‚Äî advanced compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA BAA)

### Usage-Based Pricing (Alternative Model)

- **Pay-as-you-go**: $0.05 per extraction (cloud processing)
- **Credits**: Buy 100 credits for $4 (4¬¢ each), 1000 credits for $30 (3¬¢ each)
- **Hybrid**: Free desktop app + pay per cloud extraction

**Pros**: Lower barrier to entry; scales with usage  
**Cons**: Unpredictable revenue; harder to forecast; may discourage heavy users

## Localization & Regional Pricing

### Adjust for PPP (Purchasing Power Parity)

| Region | Pro Price | Discount |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **US, Canada, Western Europe** | $12/mo | 0% |
| **Eastern Europe, Latin America** | $8/mo | 33% |
| **India, Southeast Asia** | $5/mo | 58% |
| **Africa** | $4/mo | 67% |

**Implementation**: Detect user location via IP; show adjusted pricing on landing page. Verify with payment card country.

---

## Open-Source vs. Commercial

### Hybrid Model (Consider)
- **Desktop app**: Open-source (MIT License) ‚Üí builds community trust
- **Cloud backend**: Proprietary ‚Üí monetize API access and integrations
- **Enterprise features**: Proprietary (SSO, compliance, custom integrations)

**Benefits**:
- Attracts developers who want to self-host
- Contributions improve core product
- Still monetize via hosted service and premium features

**Risks**:
- Competitors could fork and undercut on price
- Harder to enforce licensing for enterprise features

**Recommendation**: Start fully proprietary; open-source core extraction library after 12-18 months (once market position is established).

---

## Key Metrics to Track

1. **Free ‚Üí Pro Conversion Rate**: Target 3-5%
2. **Pro ‚Üí Team Conversion**: Target 10-15% (as teams grow)
3. **Churn Rate**: Target <5% monthly for paid tiers
4. **LTV (Lifetime Value)**: Pro = $12 √ó 18 months avg = $216; Team = $30 √ó 24 months = $720
5. **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**: Target <$50 for Pro, <$300 for Team
6. **LTV:CAC Ratio**: Target 3:1 or higher (healthy SaaS business)
