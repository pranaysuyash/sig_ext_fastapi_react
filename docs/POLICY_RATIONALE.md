# Policy Rationale - Why No Refunds?

**Date:** November 7, 2025

## The Question

"Since it's a local app, does it make sense to have a refund policy? Or since we have gated it, can we let people check for 2-3 days? Honestly, I don't want refunds as there's no way to check if they are misusing or not."

## The Answer

**No refunds policy is the RIGHT approach for this product.** Here's why:

## Why "Try Before You Buy" Beats Refunds

### 1. Better for Customers

**Traditional refund policy:**
- ⏰ Time pressure (30 days to decide)
- 📧 Request process (email, wait, explain)
- ⏳ Processing time (5-7 days for refund)
- 😰 Uncertainty (will they approve?)

**Try before you buy:**
- ✅ Unlimited time to evaluate
- ✅ No request needed
- ✅ Instant decision (buy when ready)
- ✅ Zero risk

**Customers get MORE value with trial than refunds.**

### 2. Prevents Abuse

**Refund policy problems:**
- 🚫 "Rent" the software (buy, use, refund)
- 🚫 Extract all signatures, then refund
- 🚫 No way to verify legitimate use
- 🚫 Can't revoke license after refund
- 🚫 Costs you money and time

**Try before buy prevents:**
- ✅ Can't abuse what you haven't paid for
- ✅ Only pay when you're committed
- ✅ No refund fraud possible
- ✅ No verification needed

### 3. Industry Standard for Software

**Many successful products use this model:**
- **Sublime Text**: Unlimited trial, buy when ready
- **WinRAR**: Famous for unlimited trial
- **Many indie apps**: Try first, no refunds
- **Reason**: Digital products can't be "returned"

**It's accepted and expected in software.**

### 4. Legal Protection

**With refunds:**
- Must process refund requests
- Must handle disputes
- Must deal with chargebacks
- Must track refund abuse

**Without refunds:**
- Clear policy upfront
- No ambiguity
- Less customer service burden
- Legally defensible (they tried it first)

## How It Works

### Trial Mode

**Full functionality:**
```
✅ Load images
✅ Select signatures
✅ Adjust threshold and colors
✅ Rotate images
✅ Save to library
✅ Load from library
✅ View PDFs
✅ Place signatures in PDFs (preview)
✅ Use ALL features unlimited times
```

**Only restrictions:**
```
🔒 Export extracted signatures
🔒 Save signed PDFs
```

**Why these restrictions?**
- They're the "value delivery" actions
- Everything else is evaluation
- Can't abuse by extracting then not paying
- Can fully test before buying

### Purchase Flow

**Customer journey:**
1. Download app (free)
2. Try everything (unlimited time)
3. Decide if it's worth $29
4. Buy license when ready
5. Enter key, unlock export/save
6. Use forever

**No pressure, no tricks, no refunds needed.**

## Exceptions (Rare)

### When We WOULD Refund

**1. Technical Issues We Can't Fix**
- App doesn't work on their system
- We've tried everything
- It's genuinely broken for them
- Refund as exception

**2. Fraudulent Purchase**
- Credit card fraud
- Unauthorized purchase
- Payment error
- Refund immediately

**3. Our Mistake**
- We messed up somehow
- Wrong price charged
- License not delivered
- Make it right

**These are rare and legitimate.**

### When We WOULDN'T Refund

**1. Changed Mind**
- "I don't need it anymore"
- "I found a free alternative"
- "It's not what I expected"
- **Response**: You tried it first

**2. Buyer's Remorse**
- "I shouldn't have bought it"
- "I can't afford it"
- "I made a mistake"
- **Response**: Trial was available

**3. Completed Use**
- "I extracted all my signatures"
- "I finished my project"
- "I don't need it anymore"
- **Response**: That's what you paid for

**4. Feature Requests**
- "It doesn't do X"
- "I want Y feature"
- "It should work differently"
- **Response**: You saw what it does

## Communication Strategy

### Be Clear Upfront

**On website:**
```
Try Before You Buy
Download the full application and test every feature.
Only pay when you're 100% satisfied.
All sales final - no refunds needed because you tried it first.
```

**In app:**
```
Trial Mode
You can test all features before purchasing.
Export and PDF save require a license.
Try as long as you want - no time limit.
```

**At purchase:**
```
By purchasing, you confirm:
✓ You've tried the application
✓ You're satisfied with its features
✓ You understand all sales are final
✓ No refunds (you tried it first)
```

### Be Helpful

**If someone asks for refund:**
```
Hi [Name],

I understand you're not satisfied. However, as stated in our 
purchase policy, all sales are final because the full application 
is available to try before purchase.

I'd like to help resolve any issues you're experiencing:
- What problem are you facing?
- What feature isn't working as expected?
- How can we make this work for you?

We're committed to making the software work for you. Let's 
troubleshoot together.

Best regards,
Support Team
```

**Focus on solving problems, not refunding.**
