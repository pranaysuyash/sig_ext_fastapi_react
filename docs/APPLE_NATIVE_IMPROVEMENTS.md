# Prioritization: What to Do First

**1. Adopt macOS-Native Window Chrome and Toolbar**
- This immediately improves the app's look and feel, making it feel at home on macOS.
- Sets the foundation for other native integrations (toolbar, About, Preferences, etc.).

**2. Replace Generic Controls with macOS-Style Controls**
- Upgrading controls and icons to match macOS conventions will have a big impact on perceived quality and usability.
- Makes the app visually consistent and delightful for Mac users.

These two items will provide the most visible and foundational improvements, making all subsequent enhancements more effective and easier to integrate.
