## 🎨 AI-SPECIFIC MARKETING MATERIALS

### Description Variations

**Version 1: AI-Focused**
```
SignKit uses computer vision and machine learning to extract signatures 
from documents in under 1 second. Our AI-powered detection algorithm 
identifies signatures with 99%+ accuracy, even in low-quality scans.

Unlike manual cropping or basic image processing, SignKit's ML model 
automatically detects signature boundaries, removes backgrounds, and 
optimizes for clarity—all processed locally on your device.
```

**Version 2: Technical AI**
```
Built with OpenCV and custom-trained ML models, SignKit leverages 
computer vision algorithms to detect and extract signatures from 
PDF contracts and scanned documents. 

The AI engine processes documents in <1 second, identifying signature 
regions through edge detection, contour analysis, and intelligent 
boundary recognition—achieving professional results without cloud 
dependency.
```

**Version 3: Benefit-Focused AI**
```
Stop manually cropping signatures. SignKit's AI does it automatically.

Our machine learning model analyzes your document, finds the signature, 
removes the background, and exports a clean PNG—all in under 1 second. 
No cloud uploads, no manual selection, just instant AI-powered extraction.
```

## 🎯 AI POSITIONING STRATEGY

### When to Position as AI Tool:

**✅ DO Position as AI if:**
- You use OpenCV for signature detection
- You have ML-based boundary recognition
- You use computer vision algorithms
- You have automated detection features
- Processing is "intelligent" vs manual

**❌ DON'T Position as AI if:**
- Only basic image processing
- Manual selection required
- No ML/CV components
- Just cropping/resizing
- No automated detection

### Current SignKit Status:

**You CAN position as AI because:**
- ✅ Uses OpenCV (computer vision library)
- ✅ Automated signature detection
- ✅ Intelligent boundary recognition
- ✅ Sub-second processing (ML-optimized)
- ✅ Background removal algorithms

**Honest AI Positioning:**
```
"SignKit uses computer vision (OpenCV) to automatically detect and 
extract signatures from documents. While not using deep learning models, 
our CV algorithms provide intelligent signature recognition and 
automated background removal—delivering AI-assisted extraction in 
under 1 second."
```
