## 🔄 AFFINITY-STYLE VERSIONING STRATEGY

### The Affinity Model

**How Affinity Does It:**
- Affinity Photo v1: $49.99 (2015-2022)

- V1 customers: Discounted upgrade to V2 ($39.99)
- V1 continues working forever (no forced upgrades)

**Key Principles:**
1. Major versions are separate products
2. Existing customers keep their version forever
3. Upgrade pricing for loyal customers
4. Clear value proposition for new major version
