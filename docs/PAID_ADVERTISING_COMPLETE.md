## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: READ THIS FIRST

### Why Paid Ads Are LAST Priority for SignKit:

**Reasons to avoid paid ads initially:**
1. **High CAC** - Customer acquisition cost often $50-200 for B2B SaaS
2. **Low margins** - $29 product = need <$10 CAC to be profitable
3. **Learning curve** - Takes months to optimize
4. **Cash burn** - Can waste $5K-10K before finding what works
5. **Better alternatives** - Organic channels (Product Hunt, Reddit, content) have better ROI

**When to consider paid ads:**
1. After exhausting organic channels
2. When you have $5K+ marketing budget
3. When CAC < $10 (for $29 product)
4. When you have proven conversion funnel
5. When you're ready to scale

### Recommended Approach:

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Organic only  
**Phase 2 (Months 4-6):** Test with $500-1,000  
**Phase 3 (Months 7+):** Scale if ROI positive
