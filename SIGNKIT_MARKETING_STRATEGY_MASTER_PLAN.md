Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], and I built SignKit because I was tired of:

❌ Paying $240/year for Adobe just to extract signatures
❌ Uploading sensitive documents to random web tools
❌ Messy manual cropping that took 10 minutes per signature

SignKit solves this with:

✅ Offline-first desktop app (your docs never leave your computer)
✅ Professional controls (zoom, threshold, color adjustment)
✅ Direct PDF signing (extract AND place signatures in one app)
✅ $29 lifetime (no subscriptions!)

**Who it's for:**
Legal professionals, real estate agents, designers, HR teams - anyone who needs to digitize signatures regularly.

**What makes it different:**
Unlike Adobe or DocuSign, SignKit is:
- Privacy-first (100% offline)
- One-time payment (not $10-20/month forever)
- Purpose-built for signature extraction (not a bloated PDF suite)

**Special offer for Product Hunt:**
First 500 users get lifetime access for $29 (regular $39).

Happy to answer any questions! 🚀
```

### Hacker News Launch (Day 2 - Wednesday 9 AM PT)

**Why Wednesday 9 AM?**

#### Show HN Post Strategy

**Title Format:** "Show HN: SignKit – Privacy-first signature extraction for PDFs"

**Post Body Template:**

```
Hey HN,

I built SignKit after wasting hours manually cropping signatures from scanned documents for contracts.

The problem: Adobe Acrobat costs $240/year, and web-based tools require uploading sensitive documents to someone else's server.

SignKit is a desktop app (Mac/Windows/Linux) that:
- Extracts signatures from scans/photos with precision controls
- Runs 100% offline (your docs never leave your machine)
- Places extracted signatures directly on PDFs
- Costs $29 one-time (no subscription)

Built with: PySide6 (Qt), OpenCV, pypdfium2, FastAPI

Tech details:
- Offline-first architecture (SQLite, no Postgres required)
- Multi-platform PyInstaller build system
- Professional image processing (threshold, EXIF auto-rotation, coordinate mapping)
- Audit logging for compliance use cases

Launching at $29 for early adopters (regular $39).

Would love feedback from the HN community, especially on:
- Privacy/security architecture
- Pricing model (lifetime vs subscription)
- Feature priorities for v2

Demo: [link]
Download: [link]
```

**HN Engagement Rules:**
- ✅ Be humble and authentic
- ✅ Respond to ALL technical questions
- ✅ Acknowledge criticisms graciously
- ✅ Provide context/reasoning for decisions
- ❌ Never ask for upvotes
- ❌ Don't be defensive or argumentative
- ❌ Avoid marketing speak

**HN Success Benchmarks:**

| Outcome | Sales Impact |
|---------|--------------|
| Front page (top 30) | 50-100 sales |
| Top 10 on front page | 100-200 sales |
| #1-3 spot | 200-400 sales |
| No front page | 5-20 sales |

**Tips for HN Success:**
1. Post early (9-10 AM PT for visibility)
2. Use "Show HN:" prefix (gets special treatment)
3. Engage authentically (HN readers smell BS instantly)
4. Emphasize tech/privacy angle (not marketing fluff)

### Reddit Launch (Days 3-7)

**Subreddit Target List (in order of priority):**

1. **r/SideProject** (453K members - most receptive)
   - Timing: Thursday 10 AM ET
   - Flair: "Show"
   - Title: "Built SignKit - extract signatures from PDFs without uploading to the cloud ($29 lifetime)"

2. **r/SaaS** (120K members - allows self-promotion thoughtfully)
   - Timing: Friday 2 PM ET
   - Title: "Launched a privacy-first alternative to Adobe for signature extraction"

3. **r/LegalAdvice** or **r/Paralegal** (niche but relevant)
   - Timing: Monday (less competition)
   - Approach: Ask for feedback, not direct promotion
   - Title: "Legal professionals - how do you currently extract signatures from scanned docs?"

4. **r/RealEstate** (niche)
   - Timing: Tuesday
   - Title: "Tool for extracting signatures from closing documents (feedback appreciated)"

5. **r/Entrepreneur**, **r/SmallBusiness** (general business)
   - Timing: Wednesday
   - Approach: Educational, not salesy

**Reddit Post Template (r/SideProject):**

```
**What I built:** SignKit - privacy-first signature extraction for PDFs

**The problem I'm solving:**
I'm a [profession] who deals with tons of signed documents. Extracting signatures for reuse meant either:
- Paying $240/year for Adobe Acrobat
- Uploading sensitive docs to random web tools (privacy nightmare)
- Manually cropping in Paint (messy and time-consuming)

**My solution:**
Desktop app that extracts signatures with professional controls (zoom, threshold, color), runs 100% offline, and places signatures directly on PDFs.

**Tech stack:**
- Frontend: PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- Image processing: OpenCV
- PDF: pypdfium2 + PyMuPDF
- Backend: FastAPI (optional, works offline)

**Pricing:**
$29 lifetime for first 500 users (regular $39). No subscriptions.

**What I'd love feedback on:**
1. Is the pricing too low? (Compared to Adobe's $20/month)
2. Should I offer a free trial, or is 30-day refund enough?
3. Any features you'd want to see?

Happy to answer any questions!

| r/Paralegal | 10-20 | 5-15 |
| r/RealEstate | 10-20 | 5-15 |

**Reddit Rules to Avoid Bans:**
- ✅ Provide value (educational, not just promotion)
- ✅ Engage with comments (don't post and ghost)
- ✅ Follow 80/20 rule (80% helpful, 20% promotion)
- ✅ Use appropriate flair
- ❌ Don't spam multiple subs in one day

How legal professionals waste 10+ hours/month on signature extraction (and how to fix it)

Most lawyers still:
❌ Screenshot signatures in Preview
❌ Pay $240/year for Adobe (just to crop images)
❌ Upload sensitive docs to web tools

The alternative:
✅ Desktop app ($29 one-time)
✅ 100% offline processing
✅ Pro-grade controls

What's your current workflow? [Comments?]
```

**Wednesday - Behind-the-Scenes:**
```
Building in public: SignKit hit 100 customers this week 🎉

What worked:
✅ Product Hunt launch (Top 5)
✅ Pricing at $29 (vs initial plan of $49)
✅ Privacy-first messaging (resonated strongly)

What didn't:
❌ Paid ads (too expensive, CAC >$100)
❌ Freemium model (complexity not worth it)

Key learning: Distribution > Product perfection

[Screenshot of dashboard]
```

**Friday - Customer Story:**
```
Meet Sarah, a paralegal who processes 50+ contracts monthly.

Before SignKit:
"I spent 2 hours every week manually cropping signatures from scanned documents. Adobe was overkill at $20/month just for this task."

After SignKit:
"Paid $29 once. Extract 10 signatures in 5 minutes. Already saved 20+ hours."

**LinkedIn Ads (Month 6+ optional):**

```

**Email 2 (Day 2): Education - The Problem**
```
Subject: Why web-based signature tools are a privacy risk

Hi [Name],

Most lawyers, real estate agents, and business pros upload sensitive documents to web tools for signature extraction.

The problem? You're trusting:
- A company you don't know
- A server you can't see
- Terms you didn't read

What happens to your client's NDA after you upload it? [Read more]

Tomorrow I'll show you a safer alternative.

[Your Name]
```

**Email 3 (Day 4): Solution Introduction**
```
Subject: The offline alternative to Adobe and web tools

[Name],

Here's how SignKit solves the privacy problem:

✓ 100% offline (your docs never leave your computer)
✓ One-time $29 payment (vs $240/year for Adobe)

**Email 5 (Day 8): Objection Handling**

Subject: "Do I really need a desktop app for this?"

Great question. Here's when SignKit makes sense:

✓ You process 5+ documents with signatures per month
✓ You work with confidential/sensitive documents
✓ You're tired of subscription fees piling up

If that's you, SignKit pays for itself in 1-2 months vs Adobe.

Still not sure? Reply with your questions.

### Audience-Specific Messaging

```

**For Real Estate Agents:**

### Objection Handling Copy

**Objection 1: "Can't I just use Photoshop/GIMP for free?"**

Response:
"Absolutely! Photoshop works if you're comfortable with:
- Learning complex tools (overkill for signature extraction)
- Manual cropping/threshold adjustments
- 5-10 minutes per signature

SignKit is purpose-built for this one task: extract a signature in 30 seconds with pro-grade controls. It's the difference between using a Swiss Army knife and a scalpel.

For $29 one-time, it pays for itself after 3-4 signatures (vs your hourly rate)."

---

**Objection 2: "I only need this once or twice a year."**

Response:
"Fair point! Here's how to think about it:

If you use it 2x/year for 5 years = 10 uses.
$29 ÷ 10 = $2.90 per use.

Compare that to:
- Hiring a VA on Fiverr: $5-10 per signature
- Adobe Acrobat 1-month trial: $19.99 (and you'll forget to cancel)

Also, once you have it, you'll find more uses: email signatures, contract templates, branding assets.

Plus, 30-day money-back guarantee. Try it, extract your signatures, and decide."

---

**Objection 3: "Why not just use a free web tool?"**

Response:
"Great question. Web tools work if you're okay with:

❌ Uploading your signed contract (NDA, lease, employment agreement) to a server you don't control
❌ Trusting a random website's privacy policy
❌ Inconsistent quality (most web tools use basic cropping, not professional image processing)

SignKit runs 100% offline:
✅ Your docs never leave your computer
✅ Professional controls (zoom, threshold, color adjustment)
✅ Same tool legal pros and designers use

For sensitive documents, privacy isn't optional. That's why 500+ professionals chose SignKit."

---

**Objection 4: "My company pays for Adobe, so it's 'free' for me."**

Response:
"True! If you already have Adobe Acrobat Pro, you're set.

But here's why some Adobe users still buy SignKit:

1. **Speed**: SignKit is faster for signature extraction specifically (no bloated menus)
2. **Personal use**: Your company license doesn't cover personal/side business docs
3. **Offline**: SignKit works without Adobe's cloud login (useful for sensitive docs)
4. **Backup**: What happens when you leave the company and lose Adobe access?

Think of SignKit as your personal tool that you own forever, separate from company software you'll eventually lose access to."

### Social Proof Templates

**Tweet Template:**
```
Just extracted 10 signatures in 5 minutes with @SignKitApp.

Used to waste 2 hours/week doing this manually in Photoshop.

$29 one-time payment. Already paid for itself in Week 1.

If you process contracts/legal docs regularly, this is a no-brainer.
```

**LinkedIn Post Template:**
```
PSA for legal professionals:

Stop screenshotting signatures in Preview.

I've been using SignKit for 30 days and it's saved me ~8 hours of tedious cropping.

→ Extract signatures from scans in 30 seconds
→ 100% offline (your client docs stay private)
→ $29 lifetime (vs Adobe's $240/year)

Best $29 I've spent on productivity this year.

```

**Reddit Comment Template (when someone asks "how do you extract signatures?"):**
```
I used to do this manually in Photoshop until I found SignKit.

It's a desktop app ($29 one-time) that lets you:
- Draw a box around the signature
- Adjust threshold/color with live preview
- Export as transparent PNG in ~30 seconds

100% offline (docs never uploaded to cloud).

There are free web tools too, but I didn't want to upload client NDAs to random websites. SignKit works for me because it's local-only.

Not affiliated, just a happy user. (Though I wish I'd built it!)

### Launch Announcement Templates

**Product Hunt First Comment (already in Launch Strategy above)**

**Twitter Launch Thread:**

```
🚀 Today I'm launching SignKit - privacy-first signature extraction for PDFs.

After 6 months of building, 500 beta testers, and 1,000+ extracted signatures, it's finally ready.

Here's what SignKit does (and why I built it): 🧵

1/ The problem:

Every lawyer, real estate agent, and business pro I talked to had the same workflow:

❌ Screenshot signature from scanned doc
❌ Open Photoshop/Preview
❌ Manually crop, adjust brightness, save
❌ Repeat for every signature

This took 5-10 min per signature. Absurd.

2/ Existing solutions weren't great:

Adobe Acrobat Pro: $240/year (overkill + subscription fatigue)
Web tools: Upload sensitive docs to random servers (privacy nightmare)
DIY in Photoshop: Works but tedious and inconsistent

3/ So I built SignKit:

✓ Desktop app (Mac/Windows/Linux)
✓ Extract signatures in 30 seconds
✓ Professional controls (zoom, threshold, color)
✓ 100% offline (your docs stay on your computer)
✓ Place signatures directly on PDFs
✓ $29 lifetime (no subscriptions)

4/ Who it's for:

👔 Legal professionals (extract client signatures from contracts)
🏠 Real estate agents (digitize closing doc signatures)
🎨 Designers (create email signature assets)
💼 HR teams (archive employee signatures)

5/ The tech stack (for the devs):

- Frontend: PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- Image processing: OpenCV
- PDF: pypdfium2 + PyMuPDF
- Backend: FastAPI (optional, works offline)
- Build: PyInstaller (single 123MB executable)

6/ Pricing:

$29 lifetime for first 500 customers (launching today!)
Regular price: $39 after that

No subscriptions. No per-user fees. Buy once, own forever.

7/ Where to get it:

🔗 signkit.work

Also live on Product Hunt today - would love your support: [link]

30-day money-back guarantee if it's not for you.

8/ What's next:

I'm building a Pro tier ($15/mo) with:
- Batch processing
- Cloud sync
- Browser extension
- API access

But that's 6-12 months out. For now, focusing on making the lifetime product amazing.

9/ Thanks for following along!

If you've made it this far and SignKit sounds useful, I'd love for you to try it.

And if you have questions, hit me up. I read every reply.

Let's make signature extraction suck less. 🚀

I just read your article on [topic] - especially loved the part about [specific detail].

### E. Reddit "Show" Post Template

```
Title: Built a privacy-first alternative to Adobe for signature extraction ($29 lifetime)

Body:

**What I built:** SignKit - extract signatures from PDFs without uploading to the cloud.

**Why I built it:**

I'm a [profession] and I was tired of either:
- Paying $240/year for Adobe Acrobat (just to crop signatures)
- Uploading sensitive client docs to random web tools

SignKit solves this:
✓ Desktop app (Mac/Windows/Linux)
✓ 100% offline (your docs stay on your computer)
✓ Professional controls (zoom, threshold, color)
✓ $29 lifetime (no subscriptions)

**Tech stack:**
- PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- OpenCV for image processing
- pypdfium2 for PDF rendering
- FastAPI backend (optional, works offline)

**What I'd love feedback on:**

1. Pricing: Is $29 too low? Too high?
2. Feature priorities for v2?
3. Any red flags in the privacy/security approach?

## 12. FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS & ACTION PLAN

### Top 5 Priorities for Success

1. **LAUNCH THIS WEEK** - Don't wait for perfection. Ship on Product Hunt by Friday.

2. **Build in Public** - Share your journey on X/Twitter daily. Transparency builds trust.

3. **SEO from Day 1** - Start publishing 2 blog posts/week immediately. Compounding starts now.

4. **Engage Authentically** - Spend 30 min/day replying to tweets, Reddit comments, emails. Community > ads.

5. **Measure Everything** - Track sales, traffic, conversion rate daily. Optimize what's working, kill what's not.

---

### The First 100 Days (Critical Path)

**Days 1-7: Launch**
- Product Hunt launch (Tuesday 12:01 AM PT)
- Hacker News (Wednesday 9 AM PT)
- Reddit r/SideProject (Thursday)
- Target: 150 sales

**Days 8-30: Content Foundation**
- Publish 8 blog posts (SEO)
- Create 4 YouTube tutorials
- Build email list to 200 subscribers
- Target: 100 sales in Month 1 total (250 cumulative)

**Days 31-60: Expand Distribution**
- Launch on 5 more platforms (BetaList, LaunchingNext, etc.)
- Start daily X/Twitter engagement
- Build to 500 email subscribers
- Target: 150 sales in Month 2 (400 cumulative)

**Days 61-100: Partnerships & SEO**
- Reach out to 10 potential partners
- Publish 15 more blog posts (23 total)
- Start affiliate program
- Target: 200 sales in Month 3-4 (600 cumulative)

---

### When to Pivot vs. Persist

**Pivot if (by Month 3):**
- < 200 total customers (demand issue)
- < 2% landing page conversion (messaging issue)
- Refund rate > 15% (product-market fit issue)

**Persist if (by Month 3):**
- 300+ customers (proven demand)
- 3%+ conversion rate (messaging works)
- <5% refund rate (customers are happy)

**Double down if (by Month 6):**
- 700+ customers
- $5,000+ monthly revenue
- Positive word-of-mouth (organic referrals)

---

## CONCLUSION

You have a **complete, research-backed playbook** to take SignKit from 0 to $80,000+ in revenue over 14 months.

**The marketing strategy works if you:**
1. Launch this month (November 2025)
2. Execute consistently (20-30 hrs/week)
3. Focus on 1-2 channels at a time (don't spread too thin)
4. Measure, learn, iterate (data > opinions)

**Your biggest advantage:** You're 92% done with the product. Most founders fail because they build for years and never ship. You're past that.

**Your biggest risk:** Getting stuck in "one more feature" mode. Ship now. Improve later.

The market is ready. The product is ready. **It's time to ship.**

Good luck! 🚀
