# Flat Variant Style Notes

- **Color Palette:** Deep navy surfaces (#0b101a, #131b26, #192235) with electric blue (#2b6de6), signal green (#2ea043), and amber (#f7b731) accents.
- **Finish:** No gradients or purple hues; surfaces rely on flat color blocks and soft shadows for depth.
- **Hero Treatment:** Solid background with a geometric SVG pattern (`assets/hero-pattern.svg`) and animated particles tinted green.
- **Buttons:** Primary buttons use solid blue with hover darkening; secondary buttons rely on flat panels and outlines.
- **Components:** Feature cards, timeline tiles, and FAQ panels all use the same flat panel background with subtle inset borders.
- **Motion:** Reuses the original micro-interactions (signature draw, counters, carousel, FAQ) while respecting reduced-motion preferences.
