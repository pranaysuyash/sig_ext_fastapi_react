## 💬 FIRST COMMENT (CRITICAL!)

**Post this IMMEDIATELY after launching:**

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], and I built SignKit to solve a problem I had: extracting
signatures from documents without uploading them to cloud services.

**Why SignKit?**
🔒 Complete privacy - all processing happens locally on your computer
💰 Black Friday special: $19 (regularly $29, own forever)
🎯 Professional precision with zoom and threshold controls
📄 PDF signing included
🚫 No subscriptions, no tracking, no cloud uploads

**Perfect for:**
• Legal professionals handling contracts
• Real estate agents processing documents
• Healthcare providers managing forms
• Business owners signing documents
• Anyone who values privacy

**The Problem I Solved:**
I needed to extract signatures for contracts but didn't trust cloud services
with sensitive documents. Adobe Acrobat costs $240/year. Free online tools
compromise privacy or have malware risks.

So I built SignKit - a desktop app that processes everything locally.

**Tech Stack:**
• Python + Qt for native desktop UI
• OpenCV for professional image processing
• PyMuPDF for PDF handling
• Cross-platform: macOS (ARM64 & Intel), Windows, Linux

**What Took 6 Months:**
• Building cross-platform desktop app
• Implementing precision selection tools
• Packaging for different operating systems
• Testing on dozens of document types
• Ensuring 100% local processing (no cloud)

**Black Friday Special:**
Launching today at $19 (35% off regular $29).
One-time payment. Own it forever. No subscriptions.

**Try it free:** https://signkit.work
Test all features before buying. No credit card required for trial.

**What I'd Love Feedback On:**
1. Is the value proposition clear?
2. Pricing - fair for a one-time payment?
3. What features would you want added?
4. Any privacy concerns I should address?

Thanks for checking out SignKit! Happy to answer any questions. 🚀

P.S. If you're launching on Product Hunt soon, happy to support your launch too!
