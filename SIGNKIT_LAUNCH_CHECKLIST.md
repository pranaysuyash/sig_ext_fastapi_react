## CRISIS MANAGEMENT CHECKLIST

- [ ] Double down on Hacker News (potentially better audience)
- [ ] Focus on SEO and long-term growth

### If Negative Feedback Dominates

- [ ] Don't be defensive - thank them for honest feedback
- [ ] Acknowledge valid criticisms
- [ ] Explain reasoning for decisions
- [ ] Ask: "What would make this a 10/10 for you?"
- [ ] Implement quick wins if possible
- [ ] Use feedback to improve product and messaging

### If Sales Are Much Lower Than Expected

- [ ] Check analytics: Is traffic low or conversion low?
  - Low traffic: Problem is distribution
  - Low conversion: Problem is messaging or product
- [ ] If traffic is low:
  - Re-launch on more platforms
  - Increase social media frequency
  - Try paid ads (small test)
- [ ] If conversion is low:
  - A/B test landing page copy
